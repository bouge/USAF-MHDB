    "bioArrivedHow": "First Tour: Via ship, \"Queen Mary\"  - -  Second Tour: Via Troup Ship Convoy",
    "bioTripDetails": "Personal Memories/Experiences: (1) This was when the 44th moved in September 1942 to the ETO.  At the senior age of Nineteen:  I remember my first viewing of the Queen Mary.  While standing on the loading warf someone commented that the QM was one big ******** target!  Yes - She was but she was super fast, too!  I remember fondly the high quality bedroom facilities (sixteen to a small cabin) and equally remarkable dining arrangements (for thousands at a setting, a setting taking hours on end.)  For the five days/nights across the Atlantic it was:  One night on deck to view the \"Heavens and Stars\", and the next evening relaxing in our \"cozy\" bedroom suit - ah the \"fresh scent of the sea\" (sea ?)!  Witnessing the beauty of the Firth of Clyde upon arrival in the United Kingdom was honestly awe inspiring, the Ladies of the British Red Cross were \"Angels\" with their tea and biscuits.  Oh Ladies if you could only realize even to this day (1998) how wonderful you were to we \"Boys\" in 1942!  Chettington, our first Air Base, while small it still was \"home\", and the British people were oh so most warm and loving.  Then to Shipdham.  What a mess it was until the \"mud\" was conquered.  But it was a new Air Station as new as we were overseas and trying to be brave and dedicated.  What a lovely sweet and supportive community.  God certainly blessed we Yanks with such a truly wonderful people to be our neighbors!  In a Post Script sense this support and caring was equaled throughout the United Kingdom!  Then came the opportunity to raise my level of rank and growth.  The Boards for West Point, and for Officers' Candidate School, Miami Beach were truly most exciting and rewarding.  Thanks to a small supportive group of Officers(a few graduates of West Point) I was coached and \"cheered-on.\"  I successfully secureed both appointments from the 8th Air Force.  Desiring to marry made the appointment to OCS my easy, happ and forever best choice.  Amazing as it is - sometimes young people do make good decision!  I departed for the ZOI and OCS in late January 1943, and graduation on June 26, 1943.  Latter on I attended Aerial Gunnery Officers Course (for possible assignment as a B-29 Fire Control Crew Duty.)  However, luck came to my rescue, no B-29s, and I filled a draft for overseas duty that took me back to the UK, and with Lt. Col. (then) Bill Brandon's help, while both of us were at the Stone Replacement Depot, I was reassigned to the 44th and duty as a S-2 Officer in the 67th.  Luck stayed with me and I was back in the 44th, renewing some solid friendships; later-on, with the CO's approval I completed a substitute/fill-in role as an Aerial Gunner on eight missions.  This made me most happy if not nearly satisfied.\r\n\r\nSpecific Mission Comments:  None in particular with the exception of the mission that the Pilot (???) (Squadron:  ???)  while on the bomb run - experiencing great airspeed/control difficulty in maintaining his position did, in an effort to complete the mission, dropped out of the 44th formation to \"tack on\" to a following group.  In the meatime another B-24, possibly experiencing similar difficulty, of a \"up front\" group immediately filled our slot (number four, low element) and THAT aircraft instantaneously caught a direct burst of flak, exlploded and was a total lost.  As I recall the target was the submarine pens at Harburg (??).  We made it back to England but were late in returning to Shipdham because of low fuel and had to be refueled at a friendly RAF Air Station.....Jerry Can by Jerry CAn.  This was the day I learned when we returned to Shipdham of my promotion to First Lieutenant.  Believe it or not --- I truly celebrated my promotion to First Lieutenant as no other - before or later on!  It told me that I had another \"Mission\" ... I am to this day thankful and prepared to do His Mission!",

We resumed combat operations on 18 March 1945 with a Squadron Lead on a raid on Berlin.  At the IP we began to get heavy flak and high, fairly heavy cirrus clouds in the target area.  We were prepared to bomb by Mickey (radar) when suddenly the cloud cover broke, our Bombardier found the aim point and we dropped visually.  We had good squadron integrity and made a briefed left turn off of the target.  We encountered more clouds on withdrawal.\r\n\r\nCold, cold, cold winter of 1944 & 1945 during the Battle of the Bulge.  How glad we were when on Christmas Eve the weather broke and all of 8th AF flew max effort missions to bomb every German supply artery to the Ardennes.\r\n\r\nThe Smith Crew flew the 16 Jan. '45 raid on Dresden - long distance and adverse head winds necessitated landing at Orly Airdrome, Paris, France.  There were so many recoveries of B-24s and B-17s into Orly, it took 3 days to service the Aircraft to get back to Shipdham.",

The experience of \"sweating out\" a Buddy and if he was going to make it back safe.  Listining to some of the stories those combat crew members has to tell about what it was like being shot at and terrible flying conditions.\r\n\r\nI will call this a Medical Special Missions ... that took place in late 1942 and early 1943.  The English Hospitals had all they could handle so we could only do so much with what was available.  The Medical Staff would always have ambulances and medical help on standby during take-off time and when the planes should be returning from a mission.  At times when more medical was required, a plane and crew was ready to fly out the wounded or ill to an American Hospital some where in England.  Would like to point out that AAF Station 115 known as \"Pathway\" was open 24 hours and willing to help a friend anytime, that was our job.",

Aside from the combat memories of flak and fighter attacks and sweating out fuel and mechanical problems, I most remember the camaraderie; the evenings in the Officer's Club after supper with poker games and the crowd around the crap table shouting, \"two pounds with him\" as the shooter rolled the dice. And when I remember those evenings I always think of Sam (Rowland B.) Houston playing his record of Peggy Lee's \"Why Don't You jdo Right\", over and over again util we threatened to break it. Sam was one of the \"Good Guys\" of the 44th. He and his cjrew were lost over the target at Ploesti while flying an EXTRA mission AFTER they had finished their twenty-five!\r\n\r\nWhen I came out of the hospital in the summer of 1943, after a bout of pneumonia, there wasn't a Co-Pilot's spot open, and I was made a Squadron Gunnery Officer. One of my duties in that position was to fly as Gunner-Observer in the tail turret of the lead ship when the 68th led the group. On February 25, 1944 on a mission to Furth, Germany, I got credit for shooting down a ME-109 German fighter. I probably hit it, as I fired enough rounds at it, but so did a lot of other gunners. But the enlisted men on the crew got a big kick out of a PILOT flying in a turret and they all swore that I got it, making me one of the few Bomber Pilots or Co-Pilots in the ETO to be credited with a \"fighter kill\".\r\n\r\nOn March 18,1944 I was flying co-pilot for 1/Lt H. R. Nichols in B-24J No. 100112Q, nicknamed: \"The Paper Doll\", on a bombing mission against the Dornier Aircraft Works at Friedrichshaffen, Gemany. We were hit by flak over the target and forced to abandon the ship by parachure over nearby Switzerland. We were interned in camps at Adelboden and Davor. In September I escaped into France and got back to England. I reported back to the 44th and was sent home to the United States. After flying B-24s at a Gunnery School at Tyndall Field, Florida for a few months I went through OTU on C-54 Transports at Homestead, Fla. and was flying the Pacific Run in the Air Transport Command when the war ended.",

    "bioArrivedFrom": "Grenier AB, NH",
    "bioArrivedHow": "Via Gander and Prestwick by air along with 19 other B24s",
    "bioTripDetails": "Immediately after takeoff from Gander (Nav) Lt Leroy Perlowin obtained a celestial fix that we used to make our great circle time and distance turns across the 1600 mile of Atlantic Ocean. We were headed east of Prestwick when our radio operator picked up a mag heading that brought us directly to Prestwick. After holding in seven procedure turns for forty five minutes we finally was given permission to \"pancake\" (the ceiling was 500 ft and one half mile visibility when spotted the runway).\r\n\r\nWhen we took off from Gander we were all overloaded with spare parts, supplies,  and personal gear, and \"other cargo\". My best friends, Tom Cramer in AC23800, and Jim DuBard in AC23786 divided up a load of 78RPM records. I took a heavy portable phonograph in my AC23819 only to learn at Shipdham that the English current operated at 50Cycles. We had to \"play\" the records with the aid of our finger to get the RPM up to useable speed.Lateron during the war: Jim DuBard's aircraft was the first 44thBGP combat casualty (Dec 6, 1942). I went down (Rugged Buggy) at Kiel on May 14, 1943. Tom Cramer, who took over the 68th Sq when I was shot down, was killed on July 2, at Leece, Italy.\r\n\r\nAlthough the air and ground personnel were patriotically enthusiastic about getting close to the enemy to slow up Hitler's war machine we were all somewhat frustrated and disappointed by our first efforts in the air war over Europe. We soon realized that any \"trip\" across the English Channel was never a \"milk run\", that those Germans were good and dedicated in their profession. They were playing for keep!  As stated in \"Liberators Over Europe\" - \" ***  for everyone in the 44th the early years of 1942 and 1943 were lonely ones in the skies over Europe and dangerous ones.The American bomber effort in Britian was virtually at a standstill. The 44th flew three missions in December. The weather although bad was not entirely the cause. Bomber deliveries and replacements were not coming over, and North Africa was demanding more and more. The 44th was temporarily an orphan o fwar and a flying laboratory for the experimenters of daylight bombing.\"\r\nThere were a series of missions where weather, navigation, oxygen malfunctions and mid-air collisions contributed to needless losses of planes and crews. One recollection of a real snafu was the first American raid on Germany (Jan 27, 1943). The 44th climbed out of an overcast over Lemmer, Holland and got beat up by a hord of German 190s and 109s before anyone realized that we had made landfall too early. The B-17s at Wilhelmshaven had minor resistence so we really turned out to be a diversion (theirs). My flight in the right side of the formation took the brunt of the attack. Our AC23819 was hit by 20mm cannon and 30cal head-on attacks, killing Reggie Grant (Bmdr) and Mansford Deal (WGnr). Leroy Perlowin(Nav) was severly wounded, George Guilford (WGnr) received minor 30cal wounds. Almost simultaneously - a FW 190 broke off its attack and collided with my right wingman, Nolan Cargile, AC 23690, killing all crew members.Maxwell Sullivan, AC23776, was hit by 20mm and exploded. Albert Glass(Nav) was blown out of the AC, he was picked up a German patrol boat, then treated in German hospitals, later he was repatriated in July 1943. MEANWHILE - my AC had lost its #3 engine, all hydraulics, and smoke coming out of the left wing. After the Germans broke off the attack we were assisted by John Deihl (AC 41-23816) when he broke formation and dropped down to give us protection. Our Flight Engr Bob Billman calmly transferred the fuel from the left tanks to the right fuel tanks,and we survived the 250 miles back to Shipdham. The ground crew and fire rescue in chopping holes in the wing found that all of the rubber fuel cells had turned to crisp powder, fortunately a non-explosive state.\r\n\r\nThere were  many other close calls during my Twenty-One missions. On March 8, 1943 mission to Rouen, we had to give up the Group Lead and return to base with a sick crewman.We did later rejoin the group over the Channel. In this our deputy lead, Captain Price (AC41-23784) and his wingman Bob Blaine (AC23774) were immediatley shot down at the IP with only one survivor (POW). Our lives were spared by this incident of a sick crewmember (he had passed out).On the mission I was shot down this same crew member was captured and made a POW. My \"shot-down\" story is recorded in detail in Will Lundy's \"Roll of Honor\" (page 39-42). One BIG memory of my POWlife was when General George Patton entered our camp (April 30, 1945) at Moosberg (over 100,000 POWs) and personally shaking my hand after a short brusk interview. He is quoted as saying\" \"Hump, do American Officers live like this?\"",

Low level mission to drop supplies to paratroopers at 200 feet so supplies we dropped did not land in German hands. Also that there was no opposition from the Germans. \r\n\r\nNeedless to say, two of our squadron ships were shot down. No one survived on the other aircraft. Myself and Bob Vance were the only two that crawled out of our wreckage. Wounded, we hid out for about a hour but were finally captured. I spent seven months in hospitals after being released by the Germans when the 2d Armored Division overrun the town we were in.\r\n\r\nOn the mission we were shot down crew had become complacent due to briefing that there was no opposition and no one wanted their flak suit. All their suits were in the waist. Vance and I used ours and used the rest of them to line floor where we were standing. Probably one of the factors we survived the crash!!\r\n\r\nAircraft lost was \"Sothern Comfort III\". Seven crew members killed in the crash landing in Germany. Bob Vance and me (Lou De Blasio).",

We called for fighter escort, but could not get any. We then proceeded to head for our own lines. We had to throw out all unnecessary equipment in order to stay airborne. We were somewhere near Stuttgart Germany when there was an explosion. I was in the bomb bay throwing out equipment when I felt the explosion and realized the ship was in trouble and felt like it was going down. It happened so quick that I had time to only buckley one side of my chest chute to my harness and jump out of the plane. As I was floating down in my chute I saw three German ME109s following the ship down, and did not see it hit the ground. I saw only three other chutes. I landed in a small wooded area at the top of a hill. It did not tke the villagers long to get up the hill and find me. They had double barreled shot guns and pitchforks with them. I was captured alone, as the other three men landed across a large river near another village. I was put in a room in a house and did not see who the other men were until that night when I was put into a car with them. We were put into a small jail cell in a village somewhere for a few days with only bread and water to eat. After about a week or more they took us to a train station in Stuggart and sent us to the German town of Goppingen where there were four German Hospitals. Our tail gunner died in the hospital and was buried in a cementary not to far from the hospital. We were liberated on the 21st of April 1945 by the 44th Infantry Division of the 7th US Army.\r\n\r\nAfter being liberated I was sent to the 240th General Hospital in Nancy, France and from there to Camp LUCKY STRIKE for former POWs and then on a ship out of LaHarve France to the USA.",

Our engineer(Herman Sapp) got a piece thru his ankle, a piece cut my oxygen line and piece went in my back type chute. We had NO brakes or flap, belly landed. We went to North Africa for Ploesti. But did not go on it (another crew took our aircraft on Wiener-Neustadt before Ploesti and got shot down. On another mission - over France looking for Buz Bomb Sites when our escort left for low fuel UP came the Luftwaft Three fighters came in at a time with Yellow Noes one in the middle. An aircraft dwent down every time they came in. We lost five aircraft from our squadron on that mission. My buddy JOHN LYMAN went down that day. He survived the POW camp and came home. I got credit for shooting down one enemy that day. I received terh DFC with three air medals. I left for the USA before I received  my other two clusters to the air medal. I finished my tour t thrity-four (34) missions. I have visited Enlgand twice in the last four years. \r\n\r\nMy crew trained for the Ploesti mission; but, did not go because a replacement crew took our aircraft on a mission just before Ploesti and was shot down. We did not cry about it! Captain\r\nGILDART was my pilot. I met him after the war at Eglin AFB. He was a Major then. He's deceased now. He was a gentleman and a very good pilot. I credit him with saving my life several times. Ed note: Another member of the Greatest Generation.",

Kerns. and me.\r\n\r\nDay I received a field commission; orders from Eighth Air Force called for me to be sworn in at noon. After the ceremony, I left the group theater and was walking down the blacktop road toward the Tech Site. Jimmy Callier was approaching from the opposite direction..Jimmy threw a salue and I returned it. Then behine me I heard: \" I'll be dammed!!  A bastard in the morning and a son of a bitch in the afternoon\"..The evening of the next day, Jimmy and I were in London. As we were crossing the street, two Majors were crossing the opposite directon.They were: Joe Young and David McCash. When they saw me in an Officers' Uniform they were certain that I was impersonating an officer. It took a lot of talking to convince them that I was legitimate.\r\n\r\nPolesti was NOT personally my worst mission. On May 14, 1943 at Kiel Germany I was plastered to the ceiling of the ship and could not move when we dove to avoid a head on collision with a FW190. This happended again at Wiener-Neustadt on Oct 1, 1943 when we lost all the surface covering of our left vertical stabilizer. I don't know if it was the dive, the flak, or the fighters that took it.",

During the first wave of attacks,the \"CACTUS\" was hit in the #4 engine which caught fire and the ship lost altitude and left formation pursued by enemy aircraft. Shortly after this, #3 engine also caught fire with the ship losing aititude rapidly and headed for the island of Baltrum in the East Frisian Islands. Five parachutes were observed to open from this aircraft. As a large splash was seen following the ship, it is believed that bombs were salvoed before ditching in the North Sea approximately 10 miles N.W. of Baltrum Is. The ship was not seen to crash by any of the crews, but at the altitude at which it was last observed, it is doubfful if they made the island of Baltrum. All crew members were presumed killed, however the isolated grave of the Bombardier, Joseph L. Brenner, was located near Wilhelmshaven in 1947 by US Graves Registration personnel.",

Transferred to Ordinance where I loaded B-24's with bombs for all missions. Section Chief Nick Barone and myself, were given the responsibility of loading a ship with time delay fuses. This procedure was both difficult and hazadous.  We were most fortunate that we never had an accident.  During that period, Capt. Ned Brizendine was our Ordinance Officer. \r\n\r\nAs a ground crew member, I always sweated out the missions and waiting for my combat buddies to return.\r\n\r\nI look back to when I was a young airman and how scared and unexperienced we were. We were from all parts of the US. We learned from each other and shared our best efforts.  We soon became formidable and as ground crewman, we gave our all to keep our ships flying. I am proud to have served with air and ground crewman of the 506th Bomb Squadron/ 44th BG - the \"Flying Eight Balls\". It will always be a part of my life.",

And those early mission wakeup calls...then that nervous appetite facing those powdered eggs and powdered milk, breakfasts. \r\n\r\nI remember the pre-mission briefings well. We could usually tell the hazardness of the mission by the strongness of the groans that we heard when the \"target\" curtain was pulled.\r\n\r\nAfter our 7th combat mission, I was awarded the Air Medal by Col. Gibson, along with the rest of the crew. Except for the pilots and bombardier, I did not get well acquainted with all crew members as fraternization between officers and enlisted men was discouraged, and we were together for a relative short period.

    "bioDetails": "21July 1944 Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany: An armament center west of Munich.  This mission was a long one, with bad weather from the English Channel to the target. Staying in formation was difficult. The bomb run was long and we were attacked by German fighters along with dense flack. One burst hit very close and the No. 1 engine was knocked out.  Faced with the knowledge that flying on 3 engines wasn't efficient and that it was an extra long haul back to England, our pilot asked me for a heading to neutral Switzerland.  I gave him a heading, but was concerned because I did not have a flight map of that country proper. After some time and using some main landmarks, such as Lake Constance and the Rhine River as guides, we desended below the clouds over Switzerland. After circling for 11/2 hours, we could not find an airfield adequate for a B-24. Since we were running low on fuel, the pilot gave the order to us to \"bail out\", which we did.  Most of us landed near Gonten, a small Swiss Village. Soon we were shocked to learn the Hoffman, the waist gunner, was killed when he landed with a partially opened chute. We learned later that he was buried in an Ameriican cemetery in Berne. After interrogations by Swiss authorities, the enlisted members of our crew were interned in Adelboden, in the mountains in central Switzerland, while the officers were interned in Davos, in the Alps of eastern Switzerland. After 3 weeks of quarantine, those of us interned in Davos were allowed freedom within a designated geographical area; subject to a strict evening curfew. On 25 Oct. I met a nice Swiss girl, Trudy Lang, who was near my age.  After that 1st meeting, we saw each other as oftern as possible. Realizing that we had many common interests, we fell in love. And so before I left Switzerland, with other internees, on 15 Feb 1945, I proposed marriage to Trudy and she accepted. It took us almost 2 years to procure her Visa to enter the U.S. She finally became my bride on 25 Jan. 1947 and she's been by my side since.",

About the time we were flying over the north coast of Germany near the Polish border, we were attacked at 11:00 high by a host of Me-210 a/c of the Luftwaffe.  Col. Gibson broke air silence and said \"Put those wingtips in the waist windows of your wingman and give 'em hell\". We did just that, as a group, and put red tracers in the path of those fighters..Lo and behold, the fighters veered off and hit the group behind us and their bomber losses were great that day. The top cover USA fighters were late, but one P-47 spotted our flares signifying we were under fighter attack and dove down into the melee and chased several of them over the wky.  We proceeded to the I.P. and on to the bomb run. The pink flak, signaling the fighters to get out of the area, came up as we approached the refinery and very soon the black 88 mm flack came up everywhere. We dropped our bombs and turned northwest towards the North Sea; we looked back and saw black smoke climbing upwards of 40,000 ft. We knew we scored direct hits!

    "bioTripDetails": "One of most significant memories of my life was the trip over to England and the ETO, on board the SS Chantilly. The ground echelon of the 506th BS/44thBG, consisting of 14 officers and 270 enlisted men, boarded the SS Chantilly in New York on 2-28-43 for this 17 day crossing. This French ship had been previously condemned but taken over by the British in 1940. It was manned by a few British and the rest Hindu from Calcutta, India. There were approx. 1,000 troops on board for the crossing. The first 11 days were un-eventful, aside from very poor sleeping arrangements, seasickness, and probabley the worst food any of us had ever eaten.On 10 March at about 6:30PM we heard an explosion and the muster bell rang. We learned that our Captain saw the first torpedo coming toward us and he laid the Chantilly on her side and the torpedo went along our starboard hull and hit the ship ahead on us on our port side. We then changed course every few minutes by rocking the ship (as much as 43 degrees sometimes) from one side to the other and continued this for the rest of the night. Around midnight, we were attacked again. It was too dark to really see how much damage was being done, but we knew it was bad.  Around 3AM we heard another explosion and either a munitions ship or tanker with high octane gas was hit and the flames grew larger and larger, lighting the entire area.  The light endangered the whole convoy, so a British Corvett shelled the ship and a terrific explosion followed with the flames shooting hundreds of feet in the air. The ship then quickly sunk.  In our position at the rear of the convoy, there were three ships behind us and three ships to our front. At dawn on 11 March, we found that we were alone and well behind the rest of the ships.  All six ships were either sunk or some may have changed position. We felt that we were like sitting ducks inthis vulnerable position. We spent the next day trying to catch up with the rest of the convoy. Obviously, we were probably the slowest ship on the seas.  Luckily, no more attacks were forthcoming. Later we were to find out that 5 ships in this convoy of 74, had been sunk and several damaged during the U-boat attacks on 11 and 12 March 1943. The HMS Harvester was damaged when she rammed a U-boat. She took on board prisoners from the U-boat, and afterward sank, herself. It was reported by German prisoners that there were 12 U-boats in the vicinity of the convoy. Two subs were reported sunk.  Our ship was very fortunate. The Chantilly sailed up the Firth of Clyde near Glasgow, on March 15, 1943. After a long train ride from Scotland, we finally arrived at Shipdham Aerodrome on 17 March 1943.",

Donald Heaton (West Point), noticed the return of the other Groups.  A quick decision was made to continue on to the target.\r\n\r\nAfter reaching our IP (Northeast of Paris), I was looking at broken clouds almost verticle cigar shaped.  I could see the target area at a bow in the Mery-Sur-Oise river. I was lead bombardier. One squadron strayed to the left and dropped their bombs about a mile South of the target.  The squadron to the right, did not drop at all.  Why they were not dropping on my cue, I will never know.  In any event, our squadron hit right on the target.  We arrived back to base at about 1400 hours with a nember of personnel anxiously awaiting our safe return.  We waited in the dining hall for the strike pictures to be developed and delivered.  There was a cheerful, victorious roar.  We had indeed hit the target!\r\n\r\nOn another ocassion, on one of my earlier missions, we flew with one man short.  Our nose gunner could not fly that day. Our pilot asked me if I would fly the nose turret which I did. After take off and making our rendezvous, I climed into the nose turret and proceeded to try to charge the guns.  I noticed the cable which charged the guns was not on its pulley.  I reached in between inner and outer shell of the turret to try to place the cable on to the pully.  The cable kept slipping off because the pully had a broken segment in it.  I worked on the problem for about 3 hours without success.  We were in enemy territory by now and I had resigned myself to having zero guns which would fire.\r\n\r\nI looked away from the cable and broken pully and suddenly saw about 15-18 Me109's at 12 O'clock high.  I called the crew to alert them. Not having any guns, I was helpless.  At the last moment, the enemy veered off to chase another group.  They were so close I could see the silhouette of the pilots. The good Lord had his hand on all of us.",

The flak had ruptured my K-Ration and an orange that were sitting in my cubby hole.  I was glad to be alive, but mad that I had nothing to eat the whole way back to England. \r\n\r\nI cannot write of my experiences without mentioning my admiration and gratitude to my pilot, GEORGE M. BEIBER. Although he was only four years older than I, he had a maturity that kept us all alive. He seemed to have an instinct for knowing where the flak shell was going to explode, and knowing how to avoid it.  Looking back I think we were a charmed crew. Of the four crews that trained together at Biggs Field, Texas, ours alone emerged from our thirty five missions unscathed.

    "bioTripDetails": "My first mission was to the German submarine pens at Kiel, Germany on May 14, 1943. By this date, there were 2 B-24 Bomb Groups in England. The combined groups were able to get up 19 planes in the air for this mission. 7 of the 19  planses were lost.  I felt then, that about \"three missions was my limit and my odds would be up\". In July 1943, our group was transferred to North Africa from Shipham. We found out we would be flying a low level mission to Ploesti, Romania. In the briefing  we were told that we were going in low because the enemy had so many AA guns there. Their guns would not come down to a horizontal position, so our planes could fly below the German 88's that were in place. We were told that there would be many fighter aircraft to engage us and that the expected losses for us were 50%. We were also told that if we lost 100% of our planes, that it would be worth it to the war effort. We left Bengasi early the morning of 1 Aug. with delayed action fuse bombs. Acid fuse bombs were dangerous because they had a glass with acid in it, and if the glass got broken or cracked, the acid leaked and caused the bomb to explode. As we approached our target, there was a \r\nB-24 on the ground with the crew lined up beside it waving to us. On the bomb run there was lots of smoke and machine gun fire. We pulled up to 150 feet to get over the towers of the refinery.  As we were going over the top, the #3 engine quit. the co-pilot reached to hit the feathering button, but hit the #4 instead at about the same time.  It was a lucky mistake because when the co-pilot saw what he had done, he un-feathered it. It raced before it caught, or before the governor caught it, causing lots of vibration, then the #3 engine started. It was found later that a barrage balloon cable had cut into the wing, grounding the #3 magneto wire. The vibration had shaken it loose!!  It looked like one of every three planes was on fire as we left the target. One plane, on fire from wing-tip to wing-tip, pulled straight up.  We passed under it.  Two people bailed out and it nosed back into the ground.  Shortly after that , a fighter plane attacked from the rear.  He didn't want to pull up because too many guns would be able to shoot at him.  He passed by our right wing close enough I could see his face, but could not get a shot because he was between us and our other planes. When he was a little ahead of us, he hit the ground in a ball of flames.  We pulled up to get over the fire.  This trip lasted over 14 hours. Of the 25 missions that I flew, the most famous and dangerous one, was this raid to Ploesti called \"Tidal Wave\". I was lucky to have survived it. There were 179 B-24's from 5 Bomb Groups that carried 1600 men, flying from five air bases around Bengasi, Libya that day, to bomb Ploesti.  54 aircraft and 310 men did not make it back. We wrecked the refinery, but the Germans built it back in a matter of months, and it had to be bombed again, but from a higher level.",

A month later I was sent to Keesler Field in Biloxi, Miss. to Airplane Mechanics School. In May after graduating, I was sent to Barksdale Field, LA. where I joined the 44thBG and the 68thBS.  I was made Staff Sgt. and Crew Chief in Aug. 42.  There were no more openings for Tech. or Master Sgt's, so I stayed a Staff for the duration of the war. I left the 68th BS in Oct. 42 to join the 506thBS, which was coming to Shipdham in Feb. of 1943. My Commanding Officer told me that a new Squadron of B-24's would be arriving from the States \"with no mechanics\" and my chances were good that I could make Master Sgt., as the other Crew Chiefs were.  When the 506th arrive, I learned they came with their own Crew Chiefs and ALL of them were Master Sgts. Just my luck!  It took me two months to get back to the 68thBS.",

The bravery & heroic actions of my fellow crew members. We flew 32 missions in the 70 days we were operational. Our crew was credited with 6 enemy planes& 3 probable. We considered Lt. Conrad Menzel one of the finest pilots in the 8th AF and it is unfortunate that he died in 1993. Truly one of the greatest and most esteemed men I have ever had the fortune to know.

After bombs away, attacked by Yellow-nosed Me109's. #2 engine hit by 20MM cannon. Sgt. Branson was credited with shooting down 2 of the attackers and I believed was awarded a medal). The prop. controls, hydraulics, oxygen, all shot out. Navigator (Lt. Bennett) wounded & flying speed down to minimum to sustain flight. At 5000 ft. started to jettison all loose equip. into North Sea. We were consistently loosing altitude. Finally reached England & Shipdham with no flaps nor nose gear. Had one pass with no possibility of go-around and straight in approach by Lt. Conrad Menzel our pilot. Our plane had no flaps, nose gear or brakes. Its left gear collapsed on landing. Our pilot displayed great courage, skill and coolness in making this landing. He should have received the Silver Star. The ship did not blowup on landing. This plane was later sent to a repair depot & the catwalk spar was repaired by chaining a telephone pole to it. The ship returned to service and appropiatly named the \"Flying Log\". This aircraft crashed again at Shipdham in Aug. of 1944 minutes after taking off on a mission with a full bomb load killing the entire crew and completely destroying the \"Flying Log\".",

    "bioTripDetails": "Three missions stand out for me. On one mission, we had just crossed the North Sea and entered the first flak area.  I was looking out the starboard side and saw a B-24 close to us get a direct hit and explode in a large ball of fire. Nothing was left of the A/C or crew. \r\n\r\nOn another mission to Berlin, the flak was very close and intense.  Our aircraft shook with every close burst and a piece of flak went through our ship just inches from me. I saw some fellow floating down in his parachute amidst all of that chaos and I've often wondered if the poor chap made it to the ground still alive. \r\n\r\nMy last mission was probably the most memorable. We were on a low level mission of 24 March 1945 while supplying our paratroops and glider troops that had landed across the Rhine river near Wesel, Germany. Flying at about 200 feet, we took a bad hit from ground fire causing the aircraft to shudder. We were on fire in the bomb bay and a starboard engine was aflame. Lt. Max E. Chandler our pilot, apparently lost control of the aircraft as we hit the ground with the aft part of the ship. We then continued to be airborne for approx. 90 seconds and then crashed. Moments later the ship exploded. Sgt. Louis DeBlasio and I were partially thrown clear and though we were wounded, we managed to crawl away from the burning wreckage just before it exploded.  The rest of our crew were not so fortunate as they were killed in the crash and/or the explosion. Shortly after, Lou and I were captured along with a P-47 pilot who had to bail out close to the ground. A German artillery unit turned us over to a German Medical unit and we ended up in German hospitals.",

Among these were Berlin, Brunswick, Munster, Bernberg, Lechfeld, Solingen, Calais, The rocket sites in France and Norway. In my time in the service, I have been shot down, have parachuted and have survived a crash landing. I was narrowly missed by flak and fighters and I scored one victory by shooting down an enemy fighter. I feel all of this was nothing compared to two of my fellow crew members, Lt. David Edmonds, killed on return from a mission in March 1944 and T/Sgt. Abe Sofferman, shot by the Germans after parachuting into Nazi occupied Belgium.\r\n\r\nIn my time of service, I figured while I was over enemy territory, I was missed by 1,000 flak guns, 400 fighters and dropped 20,000 pounds of bombs or more, on enemy targets.  I am proud of the way my fellow aircrew acted and by the thousands of others in the 8th AF. I also admire the bravery of the enemy pilots of the fighters who opposed us.  Both sides in the airwar exhibited great courage and carried out their duties.  Sorrrow should be extended to the hundreds and thousands of enemy pilots who died in battle as well as those on our side.  There are no winners in war.",

The group was in final training and we left only a couple of weeks later for overseas.  First an unforgetable train ride from Oklahoma City to Ft. Dix, NJ!  Then aboard the biggest ship I had ever seen!",
    "bioTripDetails": "Going Overseas:  Going aboard I was handed a ticket that said Cabin A85-Double Occupancy.  I thought this was going to be great - 2 guys to a room!  How wrong I was!  When I reached the room I saw about a dozen bunks and found out that \"double occupancy\" meant 24 hrs in room and 24 hrs on deck!  Even in August it was cold on deck at night.  I finally found a little nook out of the wind to sleep in.  I got the bunk in the room right by the portholes.  It was interesting to watch the ocean and how far the ship rolled while zigzagging to avoid any subs.  Also, when on water I real hungry and 2 meals a day were not enough.  I came across a pal from radio school who wasn't eating so I borrowed his mess pass a few times for some extra meals!  When we arrived at Greenock, Scotland, I was not happy to see how everything and everybody seemed so tired and worn and dirty.  It was easy to see that they had been having a hard time.\r\n\r\n\r\nMemories while Overseas: The rewards of trips to the Holy Land while in Africa seeing the pyramids and Sphinx.  Trip to Paris for Easter '45.  The flight over Germany and the Rhine after surrender and the incredible destruction.  Trips to London and Scotland.  The generosity of the British people with what little they had.  London on VE night was utter madness!",

Sgt. Tillet was in charge of the GIs and Corporal Thomas Hatten was in charge of the RAF.",

As we neared our target (Bernberg Fighter Factory) I suddenly lost all power and control of my turret and its guns.  I reported this on the intercom, but no emergency crank was available up front to get me out and I couldn't get back in the plane.  Then enemy ME-410's struck, clobbering the squadron below us!  I had said my prayers and figured I was a gonner if the plane sustained any serious damage when someone brought up the emergency crank from the tail gunner's station and freed me.  This was after the \"action\" was over and a rescue could be affected.  I never found out why the turret malfunctioned.   What an initiation.\r\n\r\nI continued to serve on Lt. George Beiber's crew for the remainder of my tour of duty.  Ground crew maintenance wa sexcellent and morale on the \"Consolidated Mess\" aircraft was high!",

We flew a decoy mission over the North Sea.\r\n                                   One our groups was attacked by JU-88's and we all got credit\r\n                                   for a mission\r\nNovember 03, 1943    -  Bombed Wilhemshaven, Germany\r\nNovember 05, 1943    -  Bombed Munster, Germany.  This was the first time we had fighter\r\n                                   protection and it greatly reduced our losses\r\nNovember 26, 1943    -  Bombed Bremen, Germany.  This was a rough mission for us.  Our\r\n                                   plane took a terrific beating from flak and fighters buty we got\r\n                                   safely back to base.\r\nDecember 01, 1943    -  Bombed Solingen in the heart of the Ruhr Valley.  We had great \r\n                                   fighter protection but the flak was very heavy\r\nDecember 05, 1943    -  Bombed an air field at Cognac, France\r\nDecember 13, 1943    -  Kiel - we led the entire 2nd Division on Kiel.  Major Kahl flew with\r\n                                   us as COMMAND PILOT.\r\nDecember 20, 1943    -  Bombed Bremen with excellent results.  Martin was to lead but he \r\n                                   aborted early and we took over the lead and bombed the target\r\n                                   with good results.\r\nDecember 22, 1943    -  Bombed a V-2 rocket installation with good results.\r\nJanuary 05, 1944       -  Led raid on Keil with Col Culbertson as Command Pilot.  We were\r\n                                  out of position at the target so he ordered us to turn and bomb the\r\n                                  target directly into the wind.  We dropped bombs directly on target\r\n                                  but at that slow speed; we all aged ten years.\r\nJanuary 30, 1944       -  Bombed Hanover with excellent fighter protection, especially by\r\n                                  the Thunderbolts.\r\nFebruary 03, 1944      -  Led the 2nd Air Division on a mission to Germany.  The weather\r\n                                   was so bad that we flew all over Germany trying to find something\r\n                                   to bomb.  We finally returned home.\r\nFebruary 06, 1944      -  Bombed a rocket installation at St. Pol\r\nFebruary 16, 1944      -  Bombed St. Pol again\r\nMarch 02, 1944         -  Bombed Frankfurt, Germany\r\nMarch 08, 1944         -  Led the entire 8th AF on the 2nd raid on Berlin.  The first raid on\r\n                                  March 6 was led by Fortresses - a total of 68 planes were lost.  I\r\n                                  led the second raid and was very successful getting the 2400\r\n                                  bombers and fighters over the target.  We lost only 38 planes\r\n                                  which was a reasonably low percentage.\r\nMarch 12, 1944         -  This is my 25th and last mission.  Up until this time no navigator\r\n                                   from the 66th Squadron has ever lived through a tour.  I was a\r\n                                  little apprehensive.  The mission was an easy one - a gun\r\n                                  emplacement at Siracourt, France.  We returned safely.  I now\r\n                                  believe in God's miracles.",

The tail gunner got credit for downing an ME-109.  While on base at Shipdham wand when not flying missions several of us organized a 15 piece swing band.  I played trombone and did some vocals.

Was told to leave brand-new plane with them.  Entire crew was again sent to school to learn latest battle tactics.  Assigned to 44th BG, 68th BS soon after, Shipdham, England.  Flew first mission 07/19/44; completed tour last part of Nov., '44, -54degrees altitude over Hamburg, Germany.",
    "bioTripDetails": "In Aug. '44,  flying low left of entire formation, we crossed the Rhine River into Germany, caught intensed and accurate flak; #2 fuel tank was hit and losing gas very fast.  Turned back toward France and asked for fighter support, which resulted in a beautiful P-51 Mustang coming up and tucking himself under our right wing.  He had swastikas under his canopy; his name was \"Bean City Charlie.\"   He vectored us in to a P-47 base outside Paris, city name Coulomoniers.  We landed and parked the plane off to one side.  One week prior, this had been a German airfield, now a P-47 base.  We then transferred fuel from the damaged tank to the others; then went into town and bought some food, some wine, and French perfume, using the 4000 French francs from our escape kit.  Next day we flew our plane back to Shipdham.  We had been MIA for a day.  About two weeks later, we were told to report to the Finance Office.  It seemed we had spent about $10.00 worth of francs and the Finance Department wanted their money back!  No matter that we had brought back a $250,000 plane, and had slept under the plane's wings.  We were docked $10.00 each.  Is that how wars are won?\r\n\r\nIn October 1944, over Hamm, Germany, I was in the waist of the plane throwing out chaff, which to me always seemed to attract the German's radar.  Flak was heavy.  to my surrise and shock, a piece of flak came through the other side of the fuselage, cutting the tail-gunners oxygen line and hitting me in the right buttocks.  Wow, what a blow, like being hit with a baseball bat -- one big bruise.  The crew cut my electrically-heated flight suit; my pants and underwear were cut open and I was put into an electric blanket to prevent shock.  I stayed that way until we landed about 3 hours later.  I downplayed the incident at interrogation and did not encourage my pilot to put me in for the Purple Heart.\r\n\r\nI have been told that the Purple Heart now ranks just below the DFC.  Just one more thought:  I found that the result of my being in the Air Force and in a combat situation gave me a great deal of conficence in myself; also, being an AF instructor and talking to B-29 crews about those missions resulted in my becoming a salsman, giving me and my family a better living standard.  All my children are professional college graduates, one a lawyer.  I was lucky to have survived since we lost 2 out of every 3 flyers!\r\n\r\nI am putting down these thoughts in the hope that the 65% of the combat flyers who died, some right before my eyes, will be remembered.  It could have been me; even though I was a married man with a 6-month ould daughter, I felt my country needed me and what I could do would be some good.  To future generations -- I hope you are never in combat; it never leaves you.  However, if you are, it will not be forgotten.",

I was sent to Camp Campbell, Kentucky, to the 20th Armored Division in an armored Infantry Division.  There I took army Basic Training and was made Pfc. in charge of the drum and bugle corps for our regiment.  I took and passed the written exam for Air Corps Flying Cadets.  The Air Corps sent me to a Nashville Air Corps base for an Air Corps flying physical.  I passed and within a month I was sent to Jefferson Barracks, Missouri, for an abreviated Air Corps basic training.  Apparently the training schools were overloaded so we were all sent to College Training Detachments (CTD) at Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio.  After about 4 months there I was sent to San Antonio Classification Center and requested Navigation.  I was sent to Navigation School in San Marcos, Texas, and graduated  as a 2nd Lt. about 25 SEP 44.  Then I was sent to Westover Field, MA, for crew formation and crew training.  Our crew (Robert Sanders;) was sent to England as a replacement and I flew our crew's first 9 missions.  Then I was assigned to Alconbury Base for training as a radar navigator.  I was in Alconbury on VE Day.  Shortly thereafter the radar navigators were hurriedly sent back to USA for reassignment to the Pacific theater.  VJ Day occcurred while I was at Boca Raton AAF and by about October or November I was given terminal leave though I remained in the Reserves.",

Suffered a broken neck; cheated death by about 30 seconds as I was rescued by crew members as the plane exploded in flames.  Paralyzed for 5 weeks; spent 8 months in hospital at Biggs Field, El Paso, Texas.\r\n\r\n1943 - Wanted to go to war ASAP.  A co-pilot vacancy opened and I grabbed it.  Went overseas with Lt. C. Hagers crew in July, 1943.\r\n\r\nAug '43 - 1st mission (Foggia, Italy) Lt. Pimental (Henderson's crew) exchanged places with me just prior to take-off.  He was killed on that mission.  (I stayed on Henderson's crew until we were shot down on 01 OCT at Weiner Neustadt.)\r\n\r\nOn Weiner Neustadt mission we were low squadron.  The group made a hard left turn into us.  We couldn't maintain air speed and had to slide under the group to the other side - no protection for our 6 air craft.  About 8 or 9 ME-109s jumped us.  I think 4 or 5 B-24s were lost quickly.  Henderson gave his life to save ME - that I know.  A Waist gunner/Navigator Wmilliam Newbold and myself were saved.\r\n\r\nI made a special trip to Dallas, TX, to inform his family of his heroism.  Our B-24 started to go into a flat spin (2 engines out) and he held the wheel completely over and when I motioned to take the wheel he refused to relinquish it.  When I tried to jump into the open bomb bay I fractured my skull and was unconscious when I fell out.  Recovered on the ground.",

We were unescorted and used zigzag, evasive action across the Atlantic to arrive at Glasgow, Scotland on 21 June 1944.  From Scotland we went to Kilkeel, Northern Ireland for bomber crew orientation.  Then in early July arrived at the 44th Bomb Group, 66th Bomb Squadron at Air Station 115 near Shipdam, England.",
    "bioTripDetails": "On Raid #1, my left waist gun wouldn't fire.  Suddenly all the discipline of basic training and the training at Gunnery School paid off.  I was able to surmount my panic and get that gun to fire.\r\n\r\nOn Raid #2, just as we passed into enemy territory, I turned around and found the right waist gunner unconscious, slumped over his gun because of an improperly fitting oxygen mask.  I spent the rest of the raid reviving him over and over because he could not seem to get his oxygen mask fixed.\r\n\r\nOn Raid #3, we had terrific flak over our target Kiel, Germany.  In spite of the fierce flak, we only had one flak hole in our plane.\r\n\r\nOn Raid #4, a stray B-24 attached itself to our plane.  There were rumors the Nazis had restored some crashed B-24's and were using them to join our bomb groups, shoot up our planes, then make a quick retreat.  We kept a close eye on the stray.\r\n\r\nAfter Raid #6 we were pulled from flying raids and began flying a black B-24 all over the United Kingdom.  When we tried to find out why we were doing this we were told the information was classified.  We never did find out what we were doing.\r\n\r\nOn Raid #8, we were in moderate but very accurate flak.  Suddenly, I got what felt like a swift kick in my left buttock. I thought the right waist gunner was clowning around.  I checked on him but he was minding his own business.  Then I saw a piece of flak under my feet.  It had come in through the chaff  chute and hit me.  It did no harm but the white-hot metal scorched my glove when I picked it up.\r\n\r\nOn Raid #10, we flew into a cold weather front and suddenly planes ahead of us and our planes  were engulfed by a dense cloud of condensation.  When we and our two wingmen came out of the condensation we were lost from our group.  So, we joined another group.  That group felt about us like we felt about the stray plane that latched onto us on Raid #4, they wanted to shoot us down.  Right after we bombed their target one of their planes began slipping down on us.  It was within inches of us when the copilot saw what was happening and put us in a dive.  That is all that saved us.\r\n\r\nRaid #11 was a hedge-hopping flight into Holland to drop supplies to paratroopers who had gone in behind German lines.  Our bomb load was ammunition and K-rations.  The Dutch stood on dikes waving white sheets as we went over while the Germans fired small-arms weapons at us.\r\n\r\nOn Raid #12 we had to abort on takeoff  because of engine failure.  We got off the runway and were quickly taken to a brand new B-24.  With practically no preflight, we were off again.  Everything on the plane was stiff.  When I test fired my gun it fell apart.  I kept my cool and got it fixed.  We had all kinds of troubles with plane on the entire flight.\r\n\r\nOn Raid #15 we were nearing the Dutch Coast when I decided it was time to put on my parachute harness.  When I reached for it in my flight bag it was not there!  I learned later someone had inspected our lockers, took my parachute harness out of my flight bag, tossed it on the floor of my locker, and put the bag back on top of it.  When I picked up the flight bag I assumed it was just as I had left it from the last raid.  Fortunately, we did not get any flak or see any enemy fighters on this raid!\r\n\r\nRaid #21 on Metz, France was flown in direct support of Gen. George Patton.  The Germans had slowed him down, but just before we bombed the primary target we got an urgent message NOT TO BOMB THAT TARGET BECAUSE PATTON HAD TAKEN IT!  His troops fired a line of \"friendly\" flak to direct us to the secondary target about five miles ahead.\r\n\r\nBy Raid #27 we had been a lead crew of an increasing number of raids.  On this raid we had the honor of leading the entire Eighth Air Force.\r\n\r\nBad weather hit England and Europe in December.  The Germans found a weak point in the front lines and launched a blitz that became The Battle of the Bulge.  All our planes were grounded and things went bad in The Bulge.  On December 24, 1944, the weather finally broke.\r\n\r\nOur Raid #28 was the largest air raid in history.  Everything that could fly, flew.  Our target was the neck of The Bulge to help cut off access into it for the Germans.  It was a clear day, and we could see fighting on the ground, and the anti-aircraft gunners on the ground could clearly see us, too.  They nearly got us, but we escaped their fire and our bombardier hit that target dead center!\r\n\r\nShortly, after we flew our first raid the  ball turrets were taken out of the B-24's and we suddenly had an extra gunner on our crew.  It was decided three of us would rotate and miss every third raid the crew flew.  After Gunner Robert (Bob) Rusch and I missed one raid each it was decided to train Gunner John Dubrock as a radar operator.  When the rest of the crew finished their raids Bob and I still had one to go.  After waiting around a month and a half on March 15, 1945, I flew my last raid to Berlin with a crew on their 13th raid,a crew that had already bailed out of another B-24, a crew that did not trust their engineer and a crew that did not get along with each other.\r\n\r\nOn returning to the states, I went to Gunnery Instructors School at Laredo, Tx.  From there I went to the AAB, Las Vegas NV as an instructor until the war ended.  By that time I had  accumulated enough \"points\" to be discharged early.  I was sent to Sheppard Field, Wichita Falls, TX and discharged 26 Sept. 1945.  I went home to Oklahoma and arranged to attend college on the GI Bill to prepare for the ministry.  I was ordained to the ministry in 1952, continued in the ministry until I retired in 1990.  I continue to be an ordained minister.\r\n\r\nI have written a book, \"The Wild Blue Yonder\" which gives a complete story of our bombing raids.  Copies of the book are on file with the 44th Bomb Group Veteran's Association Historian;  the Editor of the 44th BGVA journal, \"Eight Ball Trails\", The Eighth Air Force Museum, Savannah, GA; and the American Room of the Norwich, England Library.",

We bobbed all over the ocean and everyone on our deck was seasick all the way.  However, on the first morning at sea I was \"volunteered\" to work the whole voyage in the galley.  My assignment was to put food on the \"dumbwaiter\" and send it up to the mess deck when they needed it.  After all those months in England without milk or ice cream, I suddenly had access to all the food, desserts, milk and ice cream I wanted.  Working the galley kept me so occupied and relaxed, I had a great time, and was never seasick.  We docked early in the morning on 28 April 1945.  I went on deck and for the first time saw the Statue of Liberty in the harbor.",

Some ten to fifteen minutes later, we realized we were loosing the formation.  The oil pressure on the #4 engine was dropping fast, so we feathered the prop.  Then we lost the supercharger on #3 and prop control on #2.\r\n\r\nThe pilot, Kent Miller, gave the order to bail out, knowing we could not get back to Shipdham.  When the Bombardier opened the bomb bay doors, through a break in the clouds, he saw we were over water.  The pilot countermanded the order and said to prepare for ditching.  When we ditched the nose broke off alongside the co-pilot's seat, and when I released my seat buckle, I floated clear of the plane.  I will never know why I was the only survivor.  The two who bailed out were buried in The Netherlands and the Ardennes.  The others were recovered in 1975 and their remains were returned to the states for burial by their families.",

Aircraft \"Earthquake McGoon\" carried  cargo of tools, cigarettes, silk stockings & Chocolate bars.  We had a close encounter with Frank Slough's ship when in overcast the entire 506 sq. had to return to Puerto Rico for refuelling due to water in the tanks.",
    "bioTripDetails": "On 1 Oct. '43 on the raid over Wiener Neustadt the ship was hit head on by fighters and the crew bailed-out.  I was captured and in solitary confinement at Hohemark, Germany.  After 19 days of interrogation, I was taken to a hospital in Obermasfeld, Germany for 20 days to treat a wounded leg.  This injury seemed small compared to a Spitfire Pilot from South Rhodesia in the bunk next to mine.  He had lost a leg and an eye but invited me to his home after the war to Pan for Gold!  I was next taken to Stalag Luft III in Sagan on 10 Nov. '43 and was there for 15 months.\r\n\r\nAt 3:00 A.M. on 27 Jan. '45, we were forced to march to \"Stalag VIIA\" in Mooseburg.  We walked via Muskow (34 miles), Spremberg (16 miles) then into 40 x 8 cattle cars for 3 more days. It was the coldest winter in 25 years causing hunger and freezing down the line.  Jim Selasky and I sucked on hoarded dried prunes from Red Cross packs to keep going, when the prunes were gone we ate the pits.  We kicked and prodded one another to keep going since \"Stragglers will be shot\"!!\r\n\r\nWe were in the dysentery infected Hell Hole of Mooseburg for about 3 months.  On 29 April'45 we were liberated by Patton's 3rd Army 14th Armored Division.  Instead of waiting to be taken out for medical examination, John Swanson (shot down on Kiel raid) and I escaped to ride the \"Red Ball Express\" (Patton's supply line) arriving in Paris on 8 May'45--V.E. DAY!!!\r\n\r\nAs the trucks were loaded with liberated French Cognac, the memories from here on are rather hazy!!!\r\n\r\nThe mission that gets you is, of course, the worst as was \"Wiener Neustadt\" 1 Oct.'43.  However, Ploesti 1 Aug.'43 rates a close second.  We encountered intense flak and fighters, and observed four B-24's destroyed (Houston, off our rightwing) with both right engines stopped at about 150 ft. over the target, Brazi Blue with right wing dipping while snapping a balloon cable.\r\n\r\nSeven hours later, we landed at Benina with the #3 engine out and #4 damaged, no hydraulics, tail control cables flayed and holes through the gas tanks.  Most of the credit for our return goes to two exceptional pilots, Walt Bunker and Dick Butler, whose extreme efforts, skill and focus made it possible for us to fly another day.  Between these two dates Bill Cameron assigned Bunker's experienced crew to lead the 67th on the 16 Aug'43 Foggia mission.  As fate would have it, for the first time ever, engine trouble made us turn back.  Only one ship from the squadron returned that day, James Hill's \"Calaban\".",

    "bioTripDetails": "Our first Mission was 9/30/44 and was truly a baptism of fire.  Our target was Hamm Marshalling Yards.  One plane in our formation was hit by flak, caught fire and blew up.  The pilot of that plane was lst Lt. Arthur S. Ledford ASM 0-705401.  The tail gunner, S/Sgt Henry P. Stark was killed.  The rest of the crew became POW's.  It was their eighth mission.  The enlisted men on our crew shared the quonset hut with the enlisted men on Ledford's crew.\r\n\r\nI flew a total of 33 missions, 25 with Lt. Daily and 8 as nose gunner and bomb toggler with 2nd Lt. Alan C. Graham's crew including one to Berlin on 3/18/45.\r\n\r\nWe were a good crew, we all liked and respected each other, and we all did our jobs well.  None of the crew was ever wounded.  We were out of touch for 43 years but found all six of the living crew members (three were deceased) through the 44th Bomb Group Group Veteran's Association.\r\n\r\nAfter returning from combat duty, I was sent to the State of Washington to fight forest fires along with a lot of other combat fliers.  We lived at a former CCC Camp.  We were on call 24 hours per day.  When we were called we sometimes rode in army trucks 200 miles to the fire.  This was my duty for about 4 months until discharged in Oct. 1945 from the 326 Engr. F.F. Co. in Spokane, Washington.\r\n\r\nMy sincere thanks to the ground crews who worked tirelessly to keep the planes flying.  The air crews received all the glory, but the ground crews are every bit as deserving of glory as the air crews.  We could not have done our job without them.  You were MAGNIFICENT!!!",

Tofte, pilot.\r\n\r\nMy Third Mission was to Koblenz, Germany with our original crew and pilot as was the fourth mission to Oberpfaffenhoffen (Munich Area) Germany.\r\n\r\nThe fourth mission on July 21, 1944 was the last and final mission for me and the other eight members of the Donald F. Tofte Crew.  On the way to the Munich area, we ran into heavy clouds which caused the formation to break up.  We were able to reform before we reached the target area but we were not in our assigned formation position.  Flak was extremely heavy at our altitude and German fighters were also spotted.  After the bombs were dropped, before we could close the bomb bay doors, flak hit the fuselage and wing and the right inboard engine (#3) and into the bomb bay damaging the hydraulic system and rupturing a gas tank.  The bomb bay doors remained open and every other door and window was open.  Since we were having trouble with an engine and the loss of gasoline, we knew we could not make it back to England.  Our pilot headed for Switzerland. Finally, after some difficulty, Swiss fighters appeared and guided us to the grass airfield at Dubendorf. We crash landed with the nose wheel collapsing and we skidded nose down into a farmer's corn field adjacent to the airfield.  The aircraft we lost on this mission was called Channel Hopper #42-95226C MACR #7286.  This aircraft was scrapped per a report I obtained through the Swiss Government.

In Feb. 1944, I became commander of the 44th Bomb Group replacing Col. Frederick Dent.\r\n\r\nShar-Hei was the only aircraft I crewed.  This plane was lost by the Group in June 1943 on the Emden, Germany mission.\r\n\r\nAll missions without \"friendly fighter\" support were extremely difficult, hazardous and SCARY! Of the original 38 B-17's which we were assigned, 30 were lost in combat.  As additional crews came in, none were assigned airplanes, just used as needed to complete crews.\r\n\r\nI was assigned to lead Division to Brunswick, Germany, an aircraft manufacturing plant on Easter Sunday, April 8, 1944.  I was command pilot, leading 44 Liberators.  German planes came toward them at the IP, head-on at 12:00 high.  We lost the Deputy Lead Commander as a German fighter hit his plane, but the gunner on Lehnhausen's plane hit the fighter, which crashed into the plane behind.  A total of 350 planes were dispatched on that mission, 44 were lost.  The 44th Bomb Group sent 44 planes, 11 were lost.  It was the greatest loss the 44th had in all WWII Operations.\r\n\r\nEnjoyed the 44th Bomb Group's 200th mission party.  Along with General Leon Johnson,  I was tossed into a pond outside the Barracks.  No one flew that day.  Officers did not wear bars to identify rank, except one Captain, who was first in the pond.\r\n\r\nI flew as Leader on D-Day, June 5, 1944.  General Leon Johnson was the 14th Combat Wing Commander.  We hit the shore line at low altitude at 5:30 A.M. bombing the big guns over Omaha Beach.\r\n\r\nMy last mission with the 44th was in July.  I led the 14th Combat Wing of the 2nd Air Division to an Oil Refinery in Politz, on the German/Poland border.  It was low altitude flying at 18,000 feet against a barrage of flak.

We also talked about the courage, determination and hospitality of the English people, the assistance and cooperation of the RAF and the mutual respect that existed between the USAF and the RAF, specifically, the RAF admired our courage to conduct our operations in daylight but thought we were\"...A Bit Balmy...\" to do it.  At the same time, we admired the RAF's courage to operate at night but we thought they were \"Nuts\" to do it.  We practised flying our missions at night but after a couple of \"Dry Runs\", and many \"Near Misses\",  we gave up the idea as \"Too Risky to Life and Limb\".\r\n\r\nOn November 23, 1943, on the occasion of the presentation of \"The Congressional Medal of Honor\" to Col Leon W. Johnson by General Jacob Devers at Shipdham,  I was priviledged to be one of the speakers interviewed for the BBC coverage of the event to talk about Col Johnson and his exploits.\r\n\r\nI was Lead Navigator on the mission to Kiel, Germany, May 14, 1943.  It was one of the greatest air battles of World War II and earned for the 44th the Presidential Unit Citation.  The 44th lost five aircraft and crews out of a formation of 18.\r\n\r\nI was Lead Navigator on the mission to Bordeaux, France May 17, 1943 with Major Howard Moore, Col. Leon Johnson and B/G James Hodges.  This Bordeaux Mission has been written up in the book \"Skyways to Berlin\" by Major John M Redding and Capt. Harold L Leyshon.  The Publishers are The Bobbs-Merrill Co., Indianapolis and New York.  See Chapter IX \"Sweating It Out\" pages 131-139.\r\n\r\nI was transferred from the 66th Sqdn. to the 67th soon after the 67th literally was wiped out on the Kiel Raid of May 13. 1943.\r\n\r\nUpon completion of combat tour, I was appointed Group Navigator and later 14th Combat Wing Navigator.",

    "bioDetails": "Returning from a mission to Naples in \"Suzy Q\" with Capt Robert Kolliner and Maj Howard Moore (CO 67th) we had a \"Dead-Stick\" landing in the desert near Bernina, Libya on July 17, 1943.  We led a formation of nine aircraft.  We lost #1 and #3 to flak over the target but decided to \"nurse\" #2 and #4 and head for home.  All unnecessary gear was unloaded enroute including our chutes after the entire crew decided to stick with the aircraft rather than bail out over the Mediterranean and/or the coast of Africa,if we reached it.  Fortunately, we reached home base and began our descent.  Then suddenly #2 sputtered and was feathered and while on final #4 quit (fuel starvation we learned).  Because Bob Kolliner was a product of the Capt Robert J. Abernathy school of coming in on final high and with a steep glide angle, he was able to maintain the speed and glide within safe limits and miraculously put the aircraft down safely on the desert floor about 200-250 yards short of the runway.  As we literally hit the ground Bob Kolliner instinctively hit the throttles as he usually did upon landing thinking we still had power.  (I observed this personally as I always left the nose on landings and stood behind the engineer.)  The aircraft rolled the 200 yards through mine fields and craters and stopped just short of the runway.  A grateful crew cheered Kolliner and Moore.",

    "bioArrivedHow": "Pilot John Diehl landed AC 816 named \"Blackjack\" at a British Bomber Base at Belfast, Ireland. The control tower advised us park off the taxi-way.  This was a heavily loaded B-24.  Turning on the grass (which was boggy soil) AC 816 sunk halfway up the wheels.  The aircraft had to be unloaded and with the help of a crane they got 816 out OK, we then flew to Preswick and on to Shipdham, England",
    "bioTripDetails": "On the Bordeaux mission 17 May 1943 - while I was on my bomb run, someone yelled out that T/Sgt Harry C. Hogan, Left Waist Gunner, had his parachute accidentally open and was pulled out of the aircraft.  Pilot John Diehl informed the crew that we were on the bomb run and that interphone silence would be adhered to.  Also, he said that after the run we will discuss Sgt. Hogan.\r\n\r\nOn Mission 29 May 1943 Aircraft 816 was a lead aircraft to bomb the locks at La Pallice, France.  My bombs were direct hits on the locks.  After this mission 2nd Air Division referred to me as the \"Lock Buster\".\r\n\r\nOn 14 May 1943 our mission was Kiel, Germany.  In the middle of the night I got a call from 44th Operations, relating to me that Operations at 8th AF wanted me to call them.\r\nThey did not have any bombing tables on 100 lb. incendiary cluster bombs (25 ea 4 lb individual bombs) they said they had heard I was an expert on \"Bombing Theory\",  I accepted the challenge thinking it would be easily found --wrong.  They were right there were no such bombing tables.  I checked with the Army Demolition Engineer, Army Armament and noone could help.  So I worked out a bombing problem for Ops at 8th AF and gave them the bombing tables I had managed to work out.  The B-24 bombing results were outstanding.\r\n\r\nOn the Ploesti mission of 1 Aug 1943, I flew as bombardier with Pilot Reggie Phillips on Aircraft 619.  We were very fortunate to get back from this hectic mission in one piece.  A few weeks later my parents were notified that I was Killed in Action on Ploesti.  I notified my parents that I was alive.  I had Intelligence contact higher Headquarters that I was alive. Newspaper reporters reported that I was OK.  My mother was awarded my Purple Heart, Posthumously.  The mission was 1 Aug 1943 and it took until 1947 to get my records correct.\r\n\r\nMY FATHER HERBERT M. LIGHT, SR. AND I HERBERT M. LIGHT, JR. SERVED IN WORLD WAR II AT THE SAME RANK OF MAJOR.

    "bioArrivedHow": "My Crew left Topeka, KS had a short stop at Camp Kilmer, NJ and boarded the Queen Mary for one of its dashes across the Atlantic.  The Queen was so fast it traveled alone, without escort, and simply outran any German Submarines.The six enlisted men of our crew were assigned to a cabin normally for two.  It had been stripped of its peacetime luxuries and six bunks had been installed.  We were bulkhead to bulkhead with bunks.  We didn't complain though, the entire ship was gunnel to gunnel with troops.  Late November is no place to be on deck in the middle of the Atlantic, but there were troops that had been assigned deck space with only the protection of a canvas curtain put up at the rail.  Those guys not only had to contend with the weather, guys coming up from below for a breath of fresh air, but probably worst of all, those that got seasick.  There was one luxury that hadn't been removed from our cabin.  We had our own bathroom with bathtub, toilet and washbowl.  There was no fresh water available, but all the salt water, hot or cold, that we wanted.  The English ship's crew had a little private enterprise going.  They were selling big bully-beef sandwiches and a canteen cup of hot tea for a quarter.  Years later, when asked how I crossed the Atlantic, I could say I floated across in a bathtub.  Being an old beach bum, the salt water didn't scare me one bit.  So while the rest of the guys were piling on the clothes and freezing, I took mine off an climbed into a nice, hot, full bathtub.  I would get out to get a sandwich and tea, and then back I would go.  I was in the bathtub one day when someone came into the cabin and asked, \"Where is Powell\"?  The reply, \"Where do you think, he's in the bathtub.\"This made me laugh, so I floated across the sea in a bathtub.",
    "bioTripDetails": "I was a member of the Lucas crew.  I flew a total of 13 missions starting with Lucas on Feb. 21. 1944, but later was with several crews. My last of 13 missions was with Beiber's crew on Sept. 26,1944.\r\n\r\nTo start at the beginning as to the Lucas crew.  It should be known that my first love was for the Navy.  After graduating from High School, I would spend considerable time trying to enlist, so much so that they finally gave me a little medal for patriotism.  My problem was a bad looking left wrist.  It had been broken, and poorly set, when I was about 12 years old.  The result was a wrist with a bad knot and an arm that was 2 inches shorter than the right.  The Naval recruiting officer, knowing my desire to go to sea, got me a berth on a Richfield oil tanker that traveled between the West Coast and Hawaii.  I would be in Pearl Harbor shortly after it was bombed.  Sometime during the summer of 1942 the Maritime came under the jurisdiction of the Navy Reserve, which meant that I would be required to attend Maritime training, which meant I would be required to take the Naval physical again. I had tried to get into the Navy, the Coast Guard, the Marines and now even the Merchant Marine did't want me.  I wanted nothing to do with the Army.\r\n\r\nIn my hometown of Torrance, I ran into a school friend wearing the uniform of the Army Air Corps with the stripes of a Sergeant.  I asked how he managed to accomplish such a high rank to quickly and was told if I could pass the mental, and physical examinations, I would be sent to a school and upon completion of the school I would come out a Sergeant.  \"That's for me\", I thought, and mentally said, \"Good by ocean, hello wild blue yonder.\"\r\n\r\nI would pass the examinations.  The wrist was scrutinized, I would wriggle it, squeze the man's hand, but nothing was asked or said about the shortness.  It wasn't noticed.  On Nov. 10, 1942, I was inducted and sent to Fort Douglas, Utah.  From there I was sent to Shepard Field, Texas where I would receive shots and physicals.  I was also given choices of what elements of the Army Air Corps I'd like to be in. I requested Aircraft Maintenance.  In very short order I found myself, along with 6 other men at the north end of the base ready to attend the Aircraft Maintenance School.  I would never attend, what is commonly referred to as \"Basic Training\".  After completing the the maintenance course I volunteered for specialized training on the Martin B-26.  I did not come out a sergeant, I came out a Corporal.\r\n\r\nThe B-26 school was located at Green River, Maryland near Baltimore.  Upon compleltion of the B-26 school, I volunteered for Gunnery School.  This involved another physical examination by a flight surgeon to qualify for flight status.  Again, nothing was said, or noticed about my wrist.  After Gunnery School, I was sent back to Salt Lake and put into a pool for assignment to B-24's, not B-26's.  Oh well, they did have the same engine and top turret.  And I did get my Sergeant's stripes.  From Salt Lake I was shipped to Davis-Monthan, near Tucson, Arizona.\r\n\r\nShortly after arriving at Davis-Monthan I was assigned to the flight crew of one Lt. Robert Lucas, as an Assistant Engineer.  I remember a group of us standing on the flight line watching a B-24 land and taxi past us.  I remember distinctly thinking, \"I know they got it down, but how in the hell do they get that big son-of-a-bitch off the ground.\"  It was the biggest aircraft I'd ever seen.\r\n\r\nWe left Davis-Monthan for Blythe, California.  If we thought Arizona was hot, at Blythe we would be in training for Hell itself.  Where we would pick up the designation, \"Pettus Provisional Group\", I don't know, but that's what we were a part of at Blythe.\r\n\r\nAt Blythe more crew members decided they didn't want to fly.  One evening, after dark, we were preparing for a cross country training flight.  The aircraft had been preflighted, the rest of the crew, what we had, was on board, being the last to board, I was just about to enter the bomb bay when my attention was directed to a noise on my left.  What I saw was a B-24 turned over on its back coming at us.  I hollered as loud as I could \"clear the ship\". and took off running.  The aircraft crashed less than 50 yards from the concrete disperal area killing all on board.  If it had crashed on the concrete it would have taken a lot more of us with it.  It seems the plane had a runaway prop on take off, and another as it turned to return. Not too long after the crash, word came down the line to get the other aircraft in the air.  Lucas asked each of us if we would fly with him, and when we took off there were three people on board, Lucas, Capella and myself.  What reason others gave, I don't know, but I do remember that one stuck a pencil through an ear drum.  ouch!\r\n\r\nThe Pettus Group would be divided into thirds for the trip to England.   One group went via South America, one group via Greenland and Iceland.  Lucas would draw the Queen Mary.  From Blythe to the Queen we would make stops at Topeks, Kas and Camp Kilmer, NJ.  At each stop we would pick up additional crew members.   By the time we reached the 506th Bomb Squadron we had never flown as a crew.\r\n\r\nWe were assigned to the 506th on Feb 4, 1944.  I flew either 6 or 7 missions with Lucas.  On the last mission, I had difficulty clearing my ears.  No trouble going up, coming down from 25,000 plus was torture until they both ruptured.  I was grounded, sent to a rest home at Bournmouth, sometime later the Lucas crew had to land in Switzerland and were interned.\r\n\r\nOne incident, I remember while flying with Lucas on a mission to Germany.  Shortly after take-off Lt. Kircher found himself in the need of a bowel movement.  He used the raised door between the waist and the bomb bay as a toilet seat.  Upon reaching a higher altitude the waste froze solid.  As the bomb run started, and the bomb bay doors were ordered open, the doors on the #400 didn't open all the way.  The bombs would not drop when Hammer operated the release in the nose, so I was told to release them manually.  Taking a walk-around the oxygen bottle, I start in the rear bomb bays.  I believe we were loaded with 500# GP bombs.  Each bomb had a safety wire and pin attached to the nose of each bomb.  Working my way forward along the catwalk, I would arm a bomb and then release it manually.  When the last bomb was released I decided to watch to see if I could see it hit.  At our altitude it wasn't long before I lost sight of the bomb, but I kept bending lower and lower to see if I could see the explosion as the ground drifted past below.  Then, 20,000 feet below, an intersection of two roads came into view.  There were a few buildings surrounding the intersection, so my eyes became rivited on that area, I was somewhat startled to see an explosive cloud appear right in the middle of the intersection.  That last bomb had landed in the middle of the intersection as if I had used a bomb sight.    \r\n\r\nWhile I was grounded I got tired of doing nothing, so I approached Lt. Harbison, who was in charge of the Group Instructors, for a job.  I went to work in the turret building and \"Chubby\" Oblack and I operated the trap range.  When my ears healed I asked to be put back on flying status.  I was required to take a test flight to assure the flight surgeon that all was OK.  That flight was scarier than any mission I'd flown.  When we took off there was a Captain flying, another officer and two female nurses.  I was confined to the rear.  Where we landed I have no idea, but was told to standby for their return.  When they did I knew they had been drinking, but the worst was yet to come.  Why, I don't know, but the pilot was instructed to use the short, cross-field runway.  That runway had little distance between the end of the runway and a bunch of trees. The Captain dropped, and I mean dropped, that plane considerably short of the runway and we bounced like you couldn't believe.  If that plane didn't receive some structural damage it was a miracle, but we walked away from it, so all was well.",

We were first assigned to Grafton Underwood at Kettering and then moved to Poddingon. \r\n\r\nWe flew out first combat mission on July 4, 1942 against an airfield in Holland, six USAF planes and six RAF.  Our Squadron Commander, Major Keggleman was awarded the first DFC in the European theater on that mission, when his right wing hit the ground and he regained control of the aircraft and flew it back to home base.\r\n\r\nIn September the Squadron was sent to North Africa to participate in that campaign.  Along with 15 other gunners we were reassigned to the 44th Bomb Group at Shipdham.  The 44th had just arrived at Shipdham.\r\n\r\nUpon arriving at Shipdham, I was immediately promoted to Buck Sergeant.  It was a rule that no one less in rank than Buck Sergeant would fly combat.  I flew my first mission to Abbeyville on December 12, 1942, although I was assigned to a crew in the 15th BS (A-20's),  we didn't fly any combat missions.\r\n\r\nMy fifth mission on January 27th or February 28th (my records seem rather contraversial) turned out to be my most exciting (if that is the word) not only did we get badly damaged , we had to crash land on return to base.  I was officially credited with a 1/4 FW 90 kill and received my first decoration an Air Medal for five missions not the destruction of 1/4 of the FW, I don't know which l/4th it was the nose, tail, midsection or whatever.  \r\n \r\nThe rest of the tour went rather the usual except on my final mission to Naples on 17 July, the flack was as heavy as any I'd seen throughout my entire tour.\r\n\r\n*As far as I know only three of the gunners from the 15 assigned from the 15th Bombardment Squadron completed a full tour.  Several were POW's and a couple dropped out of combat flying for various reasons.\r\n\r\n*I was no braver than the rest but my background in the military may have kept me in as long as I was.  I was born and raised in the military, my dad retired with 30 years service in 1939.\r\n\r\nIn High School in Denver I was a Lt. Col., in Jr. ROTC and was the \"outstanding\" Red Trainee (second year) of the summer CMTC (Citizen Military Training Corp).  This was suspended after World War II.

    "bioArrivedHow": "We flew the southern routes from Florida to Waller Fld. in Trinadad and on to the Amazon's mouth in Belem, Brazil.  We continued to Natal, Brazil, further down the coast, to hop the Atlantic near Dakar, Africa.  The ocean flight had a series of excitements, such as, wind, and hail in mid-ocean plus coming to land 100 miles north of our landing field.  Baker's radio skill got us last-minute contact with coastal crafts who led us into the runway.  As we touched down one engine quit followed by #2 before we quit rolling, and #3 quit before we parked.  Fingers were pointed at our Navigator and others for our missed landing pattern, but I recall the interest of the local flier in the cause of problems.  It was not until the 1990's meeting in South Dakota that Baker and I had an explanation of affairs.  The Germans had been leading incoming planes astray out over the desert to run out of gas and crash.  We very nearly were added to their list.  But our case also gave US men needed information which wiped-out the Germans.  Our next African hop was to the north side near Marrakech.  The war came closer home to us as we cleaned off our machine guns of cosmoline and other protective oils, and then mounted them as defense.  Our last leg was near enough German forces that had aircraft flew off Spanish and French fields with the habit of catching green crews unprepared and unalert.  We camped in tents and I made myself butt of a joke for my crew who had chased small lizards all over the area.  I had just cozied up in my cot when a gust of wind whipped the tent side against my bed.  I was thinking the boys had put a lizard in my F-sack;  I bailed out through the mosquito netting at record speed.  My rush awed the men who next cheered.  On May 22, 1944, we delivered the B-24H to Valley, Wales and were crushed to learn that the plane was not ours for combat.  Later we saw how much more mechanical work was required.  We had learned much on the flight, starting with my first power sprayers to air out the plane before landing and take-offs each day.    We also had new \"Gaucho Boots\" from South America which were very handy for extensive English walking.",
    "bioTripDetails": "On May 3, 1944 we left Valley for Stone, Eng. and did only Guard Duty or K.P. until May 11th when we were sent to North Ireland  ( on a very tired boat).  There we had a review of our respective crew roles until May 27th when we returned to England.  Early on May 29th we went to Shiphdam and reported to the 44th Bombardment Group, 67th Squadron.  We felt lucky as it was the oldest B-24 outfit in the 8th Air Force, fresh from Africa time.  Our first mission with them was the 44ths 3rd run on D-Day (June 6, 1944).\r\n\r\nWe flew 31 raids by 15 Aug. 1944; a short time and we were worn considerably by it; but had the skills of self care and for others.\r\n\r\nWe had a few \"Milk Runs\" to ease pressures from harsher flights.\r\n\r\nOur lst 4 raids were light French targets but #5 was Luneberg, GR complete with heavy and accurate flak-with us on left wing, low element!.  Next day it was Politz, GR perhaps the toughest of all our targets, plus a number of Jerry fighters.  To increase our pain, a bomb-release failure ended by a bomb hooked into the planes control cables.  Radioman Allen Baker saved us by going without flak vest or parachute-not even an oxygen mask, leaned astraddle the open bomb bay and lifted the 100 lb. bomb off and threw it outdoors.\r\n\r\nThe crew put Baker in for a Silver Star at briefing but we found out at a 1987 first crew reunion that he had not had the medal.  Without telling him, one of my pupils in Congress got with Baker's and they had action.  I took the reward to his home and his family gathered at church and we surprised him.  At the next crew reunion General John Gibson made the proper Air Force presentation.  ( Gen. Gibson was 44th BG Commander).",

On the return trip I was shot in right hip over Koblantz by ground fire or flak.  Flak hit my wallet and a coin I had saved from Havana, Cuba.  The coin was deflected (was cut almost in half) and came through and out my back.  My crews expert care stopped the bleeding and saved my life.  They are the heroes, Lt. John Hobbs & Lt.

At 19, I was unable to cope with this for we were like family.

While going over power lines, we were hit with small arms fire.  We had 14 holes across the tail.  This fire also hit the Chandler and Crandall Aircrafts on our left wing.  Both crashed, one aircraft hit,bounced and nosed-in. The other aircraft pulled up into a wing-over and nosed in.  We were the only Squadron from the 44th to return with damaged aircraft and losses.",

    "bioTripDetails": "He arrived in England with the 492nd Bomb Group.  While serving as Operations Officer, he often flew as Command Pilot on several missions in the 90 to 100 days that the 492nd was in operational status.\r\n\r\nThe 492nd was removed from operations in early August, 1944 and Col. Turnbull accompanied Col. Snavely to the 44 Bomb Group in the same capacity as they did with the 492nd BG.\r\n\r\nIn an April 28 V-mail from England, described in Allen Blue's \"Fortunes of War\", He wrote the Country over here is really beautiful but ! my is it cold.  We are busy as sixteen beehives as you can read in the papers, but we have a swell bunsh of boys and the best base in England (our opinion of course).\r\n\r\nIn a letter dated June 20, 1944, (to Elizabeth McWethy) he stated the Air Corps has been laughed at because of the medals but these kids really earn them, flying day after day into the heart of Germany.  I know fighter planes are the most dangerous to us but I believe flak is worse on the nerves.  Our courses are planned carefully and we know when we will be know when we will be hit by flak, but then we never know how accurate it will be.  Sometimes every plane in the formation is damaged and all return.  At other times none are hit but all at once one or two planes just explodes in the air from a direct hit.  We are protected from the fighters by our fighters and our own guns and we feel we can do something about our attack by them but when they hit us our losses are always much higher.\r\n\r\nLt Colonel John I Turnbull remembered by a teacher--\r\n\r\nJack graduated from Johns Hopkins University in 1930 as an engineer specializing in air conditioning.  There was not a great deal for engineers at that time.\r\n\r\nIn 1932 he went to Los Angeles and played hockey as a member of the US Olympic team.  He was most proud of his position as Captain of the US Olympic LaCrosse team in 1936 when the games were held in Germany.  Hitler reviewed the team, close enough to breathe on.  He regretted that he could not take the opportunity to whack him one and save the world so much grief.\r\n\r\nJack's success with these sports was not a small thing as they were games dear to the hearts of Marylanders at that time.  He shared his ability as coach at the Gilman School, a high school for boys bound for Johns Hopkins and Princeton Universities.\r\n\r\nHe was very interested in the kids at the school, also curious about my work as a kindergarten teacher, especially as my class of children had been displaced by the bombing of Pearl Harbor.  The little boys were generally disturbed, very difficult and unhappy.  It was possible to talk to him about the class.\r\n\r\nHe seemed to have more sides than a seal as one of his involvements was as a Lay Minister in the Episcopal Church.  He was mentioned as a well-known flyer around Baltimore at the time of his death.  Mr. Allan Blue speaks of the members of the Baltimore Flying Club going to an Anti-Sub Squadron.  Jack Turnbull was flying with a squadron at Langley Field in 1943-44.  No doubt he was a member of the Baltimore Flying Club.\r\n\r\nHe served with the 29th Division of the Maryland National Guard and transferred from there to the Army Air Corps.\r\n\r\nHe was much admired by the Maryland sports fans, he was generous with his time for relatives and friends.  He lived with special attention to Life, Hockey, La Crosse, his parents, ill or well, kids in school, kids in church, friendships and V-mail.  Whatever he was doing he focused on it.  He invested the most trivial activities with significance, turning the everyday into the divine.  Do it well was his life style.  He was a private sort of man but he was a man without margins, so much a part of life that you found yourself close to him without realizing it.  Really made of the right stuff.",

    "bioTripDetails": "The following experiences and memories of Robert Burton have been compiled by his son Charles who feels his father would be proud to be included in the database.\r\n\r\nAlthough I never sat down and interviewed my dad about his wartime memories, he did mention some of them on occasion, and he left two scrapbooks and assorted loose photos.\r\n\r\nMy father enlisted right after Pearl Harbor.  He originally hoped to become a pilot or gunner, but poor eyesight (colorblind) insured his becoming ground staff.\r\n\r\nI remember my Dad talking about taking \"sponge baths\" from water heated in his steel helmet due to cold and primitive conditions.  I also remember him commenting on the group being discouraged early in the war due to heavy losses.  He also told me that war was not very glamorous when one had to clean up the remains of friends after plane crashes.\r\n\r\nI remember my Dad telling about a dogfight going on over his base.  Suddenly, a plane broke out of the clouds and dove towards the base.  One of the ground crew opened fire on the plane with a machine gun.  It turned out to be a British plane and the gunner was threatened with court-martial.  Apparently, all kinds of stray aircraft were always landing at Shipdham, B17s, light bombers, fighters, and assorted British planes.  He also witnessed many crashes, both takeoffs and landings.  He saw Lt. Griffith's crash after the raid on Kjeller, Norway in November 43.  He has pictures of the crash site and remembered it in his scrapbook as \"the most beautifuf landing\" he'd ever seen.\r\n\r\nDuring the Ploesti raid, while the squadron was in North Africa, my father along with a number of other aircraft mechanics was transferred to service B24's on anti-submarine patrol in Newquay, Cornwall.  He has pictures of the ship that he serviced, Q for Queenie.\r\n\r\nSometime in the spring of 44, my father transferred from the 68th to the 506th squadron.  With the 506th, he serviced 2 planes, \"Ram It Dammit\" formerly \"Aries\" piloted by Lt. Bernie Scudday, shot down 6/27/44 and \"Tinker Belle\", the last combat casualty of the 44th piloted by Lt. Brown, shot down 4/5/45.\r\n\r\nI think that with \"Ram It Dammit\", he participated in a few missions.  This was his favorite plane.  I remember him mentioning that he threw foil or \"chaff\" out of the wasit gunner's window to foil German radar on a few missions.  I also remember him talking about Lt. Scudday asking him to accompany \"Ram It Dammit\" on what turned out to be its final mission, but he declined.\r\n\r\nHe also volunteered to salvage a crashed B24 close to the front lines near Brussels, Belgium.  At the time, unknown to him, his brother, Buddy was not far away in an Army supply unit.  My dad also remembered V1's buzzing Shipdham and attacking England.\r\n\r\nI think while servicing \"Tinker Belle\", my dad became an assistant crew chief and received his Sergeants stripes.  I also remember my Dad saying he serviced 10 planes during the war and all of them were destroyed.  I know he serviced \"Margaret Ann\"of the 68th Squadron, the pilot was Lt. Jansen and the crew chief was Bob Toles.  He has a number of photos dedicated as a memorial to her in his scrapbook.\r\n\r\nOne of my Dad's closest friends was Richard Butler nicknamed \"Bucky\".  They went through training rogether.  Bucky eventually became a waist gunner.  During the Kiel raid he was wounded aboard \"Margaret Ann\" losing the middle finger of his right hand.  He returned to duty and was killed 7/11/44 in \"Flak Alley II\" piloted by Lt. Bonnet when the plane ditched in the English Channel.  Although I was named Charles after my grandfather, my Dad nicknamed me \"Bucky\" in memory of his friend.  My middle name is Richard  after Richard Butler.\r\n\r\nMy Dad was very close to an English couple later in the war, Tommy and Mary Spur of Kent.  Apparently, he gave them gifts of American chocolate and other hard to get items, and occasionally he stayed with them while on leave.  I have pictures of them and some letters.\r\n\r\nThe main planes pictured in my Dad's photos are \"Lemon Drop\", \"Captain and His Kids Ride Again\", \"Flak Alley\", \"Rugged Buggy\". \"Margaret Ann\", \"Pistol Packin Mama\", \"Ram It Dammit\", \"Full House\", and \"Tinker Belle\".",

    "bioTripDetails": "Passage of years has probably dimmed some recollections of experiences as a crew navigator with the 506th Bomb Squadron, 44th Bomb Group, but I'll never forget 8 APRIL, 1944, EASTER SUNDAY.\r\n\r\nDuring the early morning hours, I was asleep in the four man BOQ room with my crew members (Lt. Hawkins' crew) when my friend, Vernon Brockman (co-pilot on Lt. Marx's crew) crept into the dark room, loudly announcing his presence in response to the charging of my Thompson.  Vernie told me that he was scheduled to fly and that he was going to be shot down and that he wanted me to mail the cigar box he was holding to his wife.  At that time we both had four missions and when I suggested that he talk to the Chaplain about his premonition, he stressed that it wouldn't make any difference, that he was going to be shot down anyway.  I went to breakfast and to the briefing with Vernie, all the time trying to convince him to talk to the Chaplain.  At the briefing I learned that the 44th was leading a maximum 8th AF strike against Brunswick with a feint toward Berlin.  (The briefer emphasized to stay away from a concentration of flak at the Hanover railyards).  As I remember, the 44th lead pilot was a Captain with Ploesti experience and that the Navigator and Bombardier were deemed to be the group's best.  I do not remeber the name of the Command Pilot.  Scheduled in the #3 position off the lead (sometimes referred to as the purple heart corner) was a pilot (Lt. Scuddy) that I had never heard of.  Later I learned that Scuddy's crew needed a Navigator, so being anxious to complete my tour--I volunteered!!  I later learned that SSgt Wallace Robison, a waist gunner on my regular crew had been \"drafted\" as a replacement gunner for Lt. Scuddy's crew.\r\n\r\nThe mission seemed routine until we started the feint toward Berlin and the Luftwaffe mounted  a wolfpack fighter attack against the 44th, diving high from 11:00 and 13:00 o'clock, spraying the formation with 20 mm cannon fire.  (I have never heard an accurate count of the fighters the Luftwaffe used in the attack but saying several hundred would seem safe.)  The exploding 20 mm cannon shells were really a fireworks display.  Some of the fighters passed within a few feet of the formation.  During the attack, the 44th Lead Pilot did violent evasive action, and, to this day, I don't know how Scuddy managed to stay on the lead's wing.  During the excitment, I was thrown against an ammo can, tearing a hole in my flight suit and gashing a superficial wound in my butt (of course my wound healed but all through the years I have kept the torn flight suit as a souvenir).  The nose turret gunner panicked, never firing a shot during the attack and bolting to the flight announcing falsely on the innercom that he had been shot.  At this point in time, I am not sure whether we lost an engine during the fighter attack or on the bomb run.\r\n\r\nVernie Brockman's premonition was right.  He was shot down in a flat sprial.  I was able to count only seven chutes.  I learned later that all ten crew members got out and were captured.\r\n\r\nBattle casualties in the nose of the lead aircraft during the fighter attack probably explains why we made the bomb run on Frankfurt instead of our briefed target at Brunswick.    The briefer was right--there was a concentration of flak around Frankfurt!!  The bomb run with the continuous flak barrage was nerve wracking--possibly more so than the stress endured during the massive air attack prior to the bomb run.  Scuddy did an amazing job of keeping up with the group on three engines.  About every two minutes, one of the the good engines would backfire.  I didn't know Scuddy at the time but I figured he had to be a Texas mule skinner, otherwise, he couldn't have known the language he expressed on the innercom following each engine backfire.  The engine quit on the final approach when power was reduced for landing at our home base.\r\n\r\nFeeling thankful to be safely on the ground didn't ease my agitation re the panicking nose turret gunner.  I wanted to see him court martialed but I was further frustrated when the powers to be didn't seem to be interested.  I later learned a possible reason for their obvious lack of interest was the fact that Lt. Scuddy, contrary to the 44th group policy, had been sent  on a combat mission with his crew without first flying a combat mission as a co-pilot with an experienced crew.\r\n\r\nMy second frustration dealt with our making a bomb run on Frankfurt rather than Brunswick.  Following my challenge, I was told that bomb release photos confirmed my allegation.  (In my later years I have always wonderd if official reports confirmed tht we hit the wrong target--bombing Frankfurt rather than the briefed target).\r\n\r\nAs I recall, the 44th officially reported 11 aircraft shot down.  But the squadron \"scuttlebutt\" was that only 10 of the 39 aircraft initially launched were flyable after battle damage was evaluated.\r\n\r\nDuring the dark days following the 8 April 1944 mission, the 44th was blessed to have top-notch commanders when the chips were down.  Lt. Colonel McTee, 506th Sq, Commander, Colonel Gibson, 44th Commander, and General Johnson, 14th Combat Wing Commander, were commanders who represented ultimate leadership qualities that helped us get through the adversity.\r\n\r\nIn summary, my other combat experiences pale when contrasted with memories of EASTER SUNDAY, 8 APRIL 1944--the mission I identify as \"The Day Blood Ran in the Bomb Bay\".  Each year on 8 april, Wallace Robison and I made telephone contact so that together we can express our thanks for another year of life.",

Following OTU at Chatham, the crew was sent to Langley Field, VA to the 111th Sea Search and Ferry Unit, this was a sub patrol unit being converted to crew assembly and ferrying operations. (We had a little, very little exposure to the above).  We were assigned B24-J. No. 429464 which in our mistaken enthusiasm, we thought, the crew and the bird, were one.  Thus we paid for elaborate nose art and a few bits of customizing: wired in coffee maker (Mr. Kowlson, Chairman of Stewart Warner and a friend of my father's gave us a special set of igniters for heaters (they didn't work above 9000 ft either) and an auxiliary hydraulic pump for the No. 3 engine with a fully shielded commutator, etc.  We lost our bombardier at Langley.  He was eventually replaced by Don Boyette but not until we reached Northern Ireland.  As was the custom of the times after landing at Valley, Wales we no longer were the sole proprietors of the 464.  According to the group roster in Webb Todd's 68th history, it disappeared, it just went into the woodwork.      .",
    "bioTripDetails": "On one of our early missions we were hit with \"AC\" damage resulting in an engine (No. 3) feathered, bombs salvoed through doors that didn't open and a number of in-flight flak alterations that slowed us down so we came back alone low and slow.  Luck was with us and a Tempest II from the RAF picked us up and stayed with us for a while until we got near Luxembourg.  He wished us well and rolled over and bailed out.  When we got back and went through debriefing, we passed along the story and our gratitude and admiration.  We even suggested suitable recognition for services rendered etc.  As I recall, the RAF type that followed up was not too impressed as it seems this lad had been through this act before, he didn't like the Tempest II (it was the king's property, you know) had done extensive pre-war European travel, language skills, etc.  He suggested that being mentioned in dispatches would suffice.\r\n\r\nThe crew was William D. Kelly, Pilot; John J. Ferenz, Co-Pilot; Frank W. Lane, Jr., Navigator; Donald Boyette, Bombardier; George G. Fraga, Engineer; Oliver M. Lopez, Radio Operator; William E, Henderson, Nose Gunner; William J. Hegelein, Gunner; Lester E. Hess, Gunner; and Paul Aragon, Gunner.  We had a total of 32 missions including 3 squadron leads; 4 group leads; 2 deputy division leads (took over lead prior to the bomb line), and 1 deputy air force lead (took over lead during assembly over England).\r\n\r\nOf specific missions:  Col. Lehnhausen's comments on the Leverkuson, Germany raid 18 Oct. '44 and Sgt. George Fraga's account of the Aachen Area mission 16 Nov. '44 as published in the 68th Squadron History, are more objective than I could be and are quoted below:\r\n   \r\n    l.  Col. Lehnhausen, brother of Edward, stated that the 44th Bomb Group filled in a      \r\nformation  with another Group.  It was three 'boxes'and the fourth squadron filled in.  Edward was in the high, right section and Lt. Dayball was in the low left.  Edward was on Lt. Kelly's wing and had a poor navigator who was on his tenth mission.\r\n       When the formation approached the high weather front, they separated to avoid collision.  When Lt. Bakalo's aircraft turned over and went down, it is believed it crashed into Dayball's.  But it is believed that Lehnhausen's ship became separated from all the others and flew over those accurate flak guns and went down.  Edward was buried at Luxembourg, while another was buried at Aachen--so the crew was scattered--but no one knows why.\r\n\r\n    2.  Lt. Kelly in A/C 806 provided the lead for the 491st Bomb Group, 2nd Air Division,\r\n8th Air Force.  Sgt. George Fraga, engineer for Lt. Kelly relates this story: \"I remember we had a full bird Colonel as Command Pilot, a West Pointer, and an all around real Joe.  Lt. Frank W. Lane was our navigator.  We were lead ship for the entire mission and it was a real lousy day.  I used two full cases of double red flares after we broke through the overcast at 18,000 feet trying to assemble the 491st planes for the mission.  It was a maximum effort strike and the Colonel stated that when we dropped our marking flares and bombs and turned away to come home the last ships in the formation had not cleared the coast of England.  I remember, too, that after we had dropped our load and I had closed the bomb bay doors, the Colonel told Lt. Kelly to \"Rack this thing around and let's get the hell out of here\".  The Germans were really blackening the sky with flak and he didn't want any souvenirs.  He was further flabbergasted when, as soon as I got the doors closed our entire crew got on the intercom and sang \"Herr Hitler says we'll never bomb this place\", so we all gave a big raspberry.  The Colonel said he had never seen a nuttier bunch.  Here the Krauts were throwing everything they could at us and we were singing.  I guess that was one way to let go of the tension\".",

She was waving her apron at us.  I have always hoped that she knew that we were the \"Good Guys\", and that she was urging us on!!\r\n\r\nWe were very proud of our reputation  as a \"Lucky\" crew.  Air crew men who had to make-up missions wanted to  fly with us.\r\n\r\nWe flew numerous aircraft - E+ #542 the most;  also on 3 Feb '45 A+ #672 had an engine shot out.\r\n\r\nWe had exceptional ground crews, but we really didn't know them.  Didn't think of it at the time, but over all these years I have really come to appreciate them and I want them to know it.",

Filled top compartment of footlocker with tobacco anticipating overseas short supply.  Instead found unlimited supply at Dunhills in London on first leave in ETO.  US tobacco went stale.  Eight months later, on return to ZO1, discovered weekly ration of tobacco at Coast Guard Station at Bluie West Air Field, Greenland was one full box of cigars!  Then started smoking cigars.  Quit smoking altogether some years later when I was older and wiser.\r\n\r\nOfficers of new combat crews at Shipdham Air Base were assigned to fly first combat mission individually with experienced crews.  My first mission was baptism of fire and a real learning experience, but found that it must have been considered just training for me, because it never appeared on my record as a completed mission, while the rest of that crew were credited.\r\n\r\nJan l, 1945 mission to Koblenz was another memorable experience.\r\n\r\nCompleted 29 combat missions, including strategic missions over Hamburg, Kiel, Magdeburg, Koblenz and many others.  We destroyed oil refineries, naval bases, arament factories.  Flew tactical mission eliminating fortifications at Metz in support of Patton.  Repulsed Von Runsted's counter attacks in the Ardennes.  Supported lst Army and British crossing of Rhine and dropped food, ammunition and supplies.\r\n\r\nFlew last mission of the 44th BG. April 25, 1945 to bomb railyards at Hallein, Austria.\r\n\r\nIn 1991 registered for voluntary recall to active duty during Operation Desert Storm.

    "bioTripDetails": "I flew a total of 19 missions.  One of which was the Ploesti raid with Major Beam as pilot, Lt. Michaels, Co-pilot.  Our regular Pilot and Co-Pilot did not make the raid because of illness.  Indelible memory of tracers filling the air on the bomb run made 1 or 2 minutes seem an hour.\r\n\r\nOver Naples the plane straggled we were trailing behind the formation because of a bad engine.  We were shot up badly by fighters, my radio transmitter got a 20 millimeter shell in it.  Our waist gunner Kallal was hit in the stomach but was uninjured, being protected by his flak suit and the huge metal buckle (to snap on a parachute).  Our tail gunner got the purple heart for a shot that took off the toe of his flying boot, but inflicted only a blood blister on him as the shell went past his toe.\r\n\r\nWe were shot down October 1, 1943 over Wiener Neustadt, Austria.  Was taken prisoner XVIIB, Krems, Austria.\r\n\r\nThe memories of crewmates who died October 1, 1943.  These were men I had flown with from the time the 506th was first formed in 1942.  We had lived together, flown together and were a tight knit group.\r\n\r\nBall turret gunner was Richard H. Williams from upstate,NY.  He was our flight engineer and would normally be assigned to the top turret, but he accepted the ball turret assignment which was much more hazardous- because as it turned out for him - if the hydraulic system is shot out then the ball turret cannot be operated to permit the gunner to get our to put on his parachute, so he remains trapped in the ball and goes down with the plane.  The operator of the top turret was E.J. Cutshall, the assistant enginer, who was too big to fit comfortably into the ball turret, so Williams, a nice guy, and much smaller, agreed to take the more dangerous job.  Both our waist gunners were big men, Nick Popovich and Lawrence Kallal, and would have had difficulty in the ball.\r\n\r\nWilliams turned 21 just a couple of weeks before he was killed, and we all had a party celebrating the fact that he had lived long enough to become an adult.\r\n\r\nLarry Kallal, my assistant radio operator, also went down with the plane.  He wore a flak suit which consisted of two large pieces of segmented metal, like a medieval warrior's coat of mail.  The two pieces, one in front and one in back, were separate but tied together at the top, above the shoulder, with a piece of twisted safety wire.  When we were on fire and in the spin downwards Larry tried to undo the twisted safety wire, so he could get out of the flak suit and snap on his parachute, but he turned the twists the wrong way so instead of undoing the twists he was adding to them.  Nick (the other waist gunner) had to jump, and the last thing he recalls is the desperate look in Larry's eyes as he frantically tried to get the safety wire untwisted so that he could bail out.  The tail gunner and bombardier also went down with the plane.",

    "bioTripDetails": "I was drafted into the Infantry on March 1, 1941and assigned to the 101st Infantry, K Company stationed at Camp Edwards (now Otis AF Base) only five miles from my home in Falmouth.\r\n\r\nOn June lst, 1942, I was promoted to Corporal and put in charge of a Platoon.\r\n\r\nThings were looking bad in Europe, many of us decided to sign up for the Air Force for 3 years.  On Sept. l, 1941, I was shipped to Jefferson Barracks, MO. One month later I was sent to Kessler Field, Biloxi, Miss. to Airplane Mechanics School.  After graduating in May, I was sent to Barksdale Field, LA where I joined the 44th BG, 68th Sqdn for the duration.  I was made Staff Sgt. and Crew Chief in August 1942.  There were no more openings for Tech. or Master Sgts. so I stayed a Staff for the duration of the war.\r\n\r\nAt Barksdale Field, our Sqdn.(B24's) was assigned to hunt German Subs.  The 68th was credited with destroying a German Sub about 120 Miles south of Mobile, AL. in the Gulf of Mexico.  I believe the date was July 20, 1942.\r\n\r\nI left the 68th Sqdn. in Oct. 1942 to join the 506th Sqdn. (also stationed at Shipdham) because my Commanding Officer told me that a new Sqdn. of B24's was coming in from the \r\nStates \"with no mechanics\" and I could make Master Sgt. like the other Crew Chiefs.  They came over with \"CREW CHIEFS ONLY\". Took me two months to get back to the 68th.\r\n\r\nMy time served in the Infantry and with the 8th AF during WWII was a tremendous experience that I will never forget, but I would not want to go through it again.\r\n\r\nI married my wife of 52 l/2 years in March 1946.  She was from Leeds, Eng.  I flew to England to get married, when she became ill and could not come over in February.  We were married March 14, 1946.",

Parker piloted \"Peepsight\", he flew the number 9 position in the second squadron, led by Lt. Richard D. Butler.  The Group Leader was Lt. Shelby L. Irby with Lt. Col. Dexter L. Hodge, Command Pilot.  Approaching the IP, the formation was engaged by approximately twenty enemy aircraft.  Despite continuous attacks a good bomb- run was made. Attacks were resumed as the formation made the turn away from the flak covered target area and Peepsight received direct hits approximately half way from the target to the coast.  Hits were sustained in the right wing, number four engine, right and left waist sections, top and tail turrets.  Control cables and instrument panel were damaged and the oxygen system was knocked out.  The ship had to fall out of formation and drop to lower altitude because of the wounded and lack of oxygen. The wounded were Lt. D.R. Simons, Co-pilot; Lt. E. L. Rutherford, navigator; T/Sgt. D. L. Lieck, radio operator; and S/Sgts. Covane, Hardwick and Sorrow, gunners.  Lt. Parker was slightly wounded, but not too seriously to bring the battered bomber back to base and land it with a flat tire.",

After a good meal and arrival of our enlisted men on another B-24, we were taken by a pair of trucks from the 44th BG to Shipdham.",
    "bioTripDetails": "After graduating from Turner Field 10 Nov. 1942, I was sent to Maxwell Field, Montgomery, AL.end of Nov. 1942 for Instructor training in the Vultee BT-13 until the end of January.  During the second week of training, one of my Ground School Instructors invited me to his home for dinner and to meet a lovely Southern Belle who was staying with him and his wife.  We became enamoured with each other and I missed seeing her 4 nights until I transferred to Bainbridge Army Air Field, Bainbridge, GA the end of January 1944 to instruct aviation cadets in Basic Flying Training. I asked The Southern Belle, Mary Lanier, to marry me 13 Aug. 1943.  The marriage was consummated 1 May 1945 about two weeks after returning from the ETO.\r\n\r\nFlew 32 combat missions with the 44th BG from 2 Jun 1944 until Mar 1945.  (Except 16 days lead crew training in Aug. 1944 at 93rd BG Hardwick, Eng.). The original crew flew together except nose gunner who caught a piece of flak in the groin.  (He recovered and was sent to Italy to finish his tour.) Crew returned home safely in April 1945.  So did the nose gunner whom I have seen at Second Air Division Association Conventions several times since we got back.\r\n\r\nThe one mission that sticks in my memory above all others was #19 on 18 Sept. 1944 to Best, Holland.  We were carrying supplies for airborne troops who landed there 17 Sept. 1944.  It was a most wonderful mission and none of us would have missed it for the world.  We went into the target on top of trees.  Dutch civilians were waving like mad as we went past; waving Dutch Flags, British Flags, and anything they could find.  Cattle were running wild all over the place.   The entire western end of Holland for 50 miles inland was flooded by Nazis.  We pulled to 500 feet over target area and parachuted supplies (ammo, food, medicine) to troops, then back down to deck again.  We did now see any opposition, but discovered  on return to Shipdham a .30 cal. hole in leading edge of wing.  It cut electric line to #1 and #2 manifold pressures and put a hole in the gas tank, which was leaking badly in the bomb bay.  Some others had it worse, engines, hydraulics, etc. shot out.  One ship ditched in North Sea, saw only 3 men getting out of it.  We flew with 66th Squadron as Deputy Lead of 3rdSquadron K+279.  The mission lasted 5 l/4 hours.\r\n\r\nMission #25 was to Ahrweiler, Germany (6 hours) for which we received a citation from General Johnson.\r\n\r\nMission #29 on 16 Jan 1945 was to Dresden, Germany.  On the return trip, we were advised that the weather was bad over England and we could continue on the Scotland or land at Orly, France just outside of Paris.  Practically the whole group suddenly discovered that we did not have enough gas to reach Scotland and landed at Orly.  Many crews flew back to Shipdham in a day or two, but it took three or four days to to get our plane off the ground!\r\n\r\nA happy memory occurred in England.  During the time I was an Instructor at Bainbridge, GA, I made the acquaintance of a Pilot Officer (now deceased) from England.  He was also an instructor there.  We became good friends but he returned to England before I went over for my combat tour.  One night while walking down the main street in Norwich, in a blackout, with some of my crew.  I heard this fellow laughing down a side street.  His laugh was unmistakable (a-how, a-haw, a-haw) and I hollered \"Smitty\" and he hollered \"Henry\".  We got together then and a couple of times at his home.  He came to the USA to see me on my 65th birthday.",

    "bioTripDetails": "Mr. Cudd is deceased and the date is unknown, but we do have some wonderful records of his personal recollections.\r\n\r\nAsk Tex Burgess if he remembers us bringing I-Bar #193 back from near Kiel, Germany on 6 July.  We were in a steep left bank about 20 miles SW of Kiel, turning onto the bomb run at the IP \"Woody\" Wilson, our Radio Operator, was standing on the catwalk opening the bomb bay doors when we took an awful blast off our right wing.  This lifted us up and over to the left and at the same time a piece of shrapnel went into the wiring and salvoed our bombs.  We went up through the flight formation, but did not go over on our back.\r\n\r\nWhen we got settled down we were all alone, so we started a turn  back to England when a P-47 came up on us and said that he was out of ammo and his engine (R2800) was running hot.  It should have been, too, as the bottom 3 \"jugs\" and lower cowling had been hit by something very large.\r\n\r\nHe pulled up under us and said that he would try to stay with us.  Almost at that same time two FW190's came at us, so he (P-47) took out after them like he was loaded for a bear and they disappeared.\r\n\r\nWe had already notified Air-Sea Rescue, so when our \"Little Friend\" said, \"Well, there she goes\" and that big 4-bladed paddle just came to a stop.  The pilot put that P-47 into the channel right beside a crashboat.  He stepped out on the wing and then into the boat.  We don't believe that he even got his feet wet.\r\n\r\nWe continued on back to Shipdham and landed OK.  As we were on the runway, one of the other B-24's made his 30th mission pass and dragged their little short antenna off the bottom of the catwalk.  We got back to our hardstand and parked our \"wreck\".  After the Engineering Officer made his inspection of it, he said that \"there was no way we could have flown this ship back\".\r\n\r\nThe left wing was hanging down so low that I could have changed the Navigation light while standing on the ground under it.  It was about five feet above hardstand.  Also, we had 127 holes in the left outer wing panel larger than your fist on up to larger than your head.  Holes smaller than your fist numbered up into the hundreds or more.\r\n\r\nIf Woody had been at his station on the flight deck he most likely would have been killed or seriously injured.  Holes were everywhere.\r\n\r\nTex and his helpers found a green painted wing for replacement that matched the damaged one, so they got the job done in a few days.  We looked rather odd with a dark green wing on one side of a silver plane.  The enemy singled us out and wanted to take a shot at us.  To say the least, our other crews tried to avoid us and stay at a distance.   Eventually, paint remover was used to remove the green paint and make us look \"normal\" again.\r\n\r\nOn another mission, I was watching a squadron of 12 Libs flying above and back of us and a bit to our right.  They were making an awful lot of contrails when three German twin-engine fighters came out of the vapor screen behind this formation, fish-tailed as they flew through the formation and knocked all or most of them out of the sky.\r\n\r\nI called Jack Booth, our tail gunner, to open up on them BEFORE they got into our range and keep firing because we were not going to take those gun barrels home anyway.\r\n\r\nWe were both firing when the lead plane started firing at us.  I could see the shells coming at us and I thought, \"Well, I am dead!\"  But again, the Good Lord was looking out for us as that old B-24 settled down out from under the line of fire, and it  passed over the top of my plexiglass dome.  SO CLOSE!\r\n\r\nThe lead German plane pitched over and went down in a dive, and out of my sight.  Jack said it went down.  The other two aircraft broke away without further firing.\r\n\r\nAfter completing my 35 missions, I liked to fly our \"Cowboy\" ship used to lead the planes forming up for missions.  If I remember correctly it had wide yellow and dark stripes (Lemon Drop).   It flew many such flights with only one pilot and a flight engineer.\r\n\r\nI remember one time when I was firing off Green Two Star shells to help the planes find us and make formation.  When we had the 44th BG on its way, we were going back to the field when the pilot said, \"You fly this thing, I want to go back to the waist to take some photos!\r\n\r\nSo, here I am, all alone on the flight deck of that B-24!!  What a day for a 19 year old!\r\n\r\nI went on to get my wings, and then flew for 28 years--loved every minute of it.",

I arrived in England without a crew and it took me seven weeks before I was assigned to the 44th Bomb Group on 5/3l/44, 6 days before D-Day.  I never saw the crew I trained with in the states again nor do I know what happened to them.\r\n\r\nIt took me from 5/3l/44 to 8/12/44 before I flew my first mission.  I was fortunate that my first mission was with a crew (Lt. Paul Durett) that was short 2 gunners and had many missions yet to fly.  I joined their crew and flew approximately 25 missions with them, flying mostly, the \"Tinker Belle\" (Serial #44-40158).  I had flown 3l missions when I was informed my tour of combat was complete.\r\n\r\nSpecific Mission Comments:\r\n\r\n My 2nd mission (8/13/44) was a troop support mission to Rouen, France.  One of our planes was shot down and we lost an engine before hitting the target.  We dropped out of formation and returned to England. \r\n\r\nMy 9th mission (9/30/44) to Hamm, Germany, we lost one plane.\r\n\r\nMy 12th mission (10/7/44) to Kassel, Germany, we lost 2 planes and one landed in Brussels, Belgium.\r\n\r\nMy 14th mission (10/25/44) to Gezsenkirchen, Germany, we lost one plane\r\n\r\nMy 15th mission (10/30/44) to Hamburg, Germany was very scary, Bad weather caused the formation to break up.

    "bioTripDetails": "In Lincoln, Nebraska, we received orders to proceed to England and the 8th Air Force, specifically the 44th Bomb Group.  We were given a new B-24 and we were directed to fly the North Atlantic route.\r\n\r\nThe next day was a Sunday, September 26, 1943.  We left about dawn and our destination:  Presque Isle, Maine.  Next morning we took off on our second leg to Goose Bay, Labrador.  At Goose Bay Mac, Callaway and I went to a special briefing in flying the North Atlantic.  We landed at Keflavic, Iceland in late afternoon the next day.  I remember it as a dismal barren place.  After a short sleep we took off for the UK.  Our destination:  A very large base at Prestwick, located on the west coast of Scotland about 700 miles from Iceland.\r\n\r\nAt takeoff the weather was clear with an excellent view of the mountains on the south coast of Iceland.  We were routed to fly at about 7000 feet.  About halfway to Scotland, the weather became dicey and we went into the overcast at about 7000 feet.  We had been briefed to make land fall at Stornoway, where there was a radio beacon which triggered a light on the instrument panel in the cockpit when the aircraft passed directly over the field.  When the light came on I turned to the briefed southwest heading and then listened eagerly for the sound of radio transmission which would identify the north leg of the radio range coming out of Prestwick.  We flew for a time and I thought I heard the range transmission .  After five or ten minutes had elapsed, the beam I thought I was hearing disappeared.  In effect, I had followed a false beam which was often transmitted in mountainous country.  By now it was night and I was only interested in finding a landing field and certainly none was in sight.  We were lost over unfamiliar country.  With my stupid turning, Callaway had no way of locating us.\r\n\r\nI should add that we had not seen sky, water or land since we entered the clouds at 7000 feet when halfway to the UK.  to make matters worse, we could not make voice radio contact with the ground station and Dick Hershey, our radio operator faired no better on his wireless.  So what to do?  We climbed up ten to twelve throusand feet hoping to get above the stuff so that Jim could take a star fix.  But no luck.  The clouds were just too high and we couldn't clear them.  So I decided to fly a due west course for a time that would be long enough for us to clear the mountainous area and get us out over the ocean.  We did that and then let down.  We finally broke out below the clouds at about a hundred feet, we then turned around and headed on a due east course looking for land and, hopefully for a landing field.  I could see the mainland while we staggered along at 100 feet or so, but no landing field.  We reached an estuary and started up until the walls started to close in. So back we went over the ocean and climbed to 7000 feet.  It started to rain like a tropical thunderstorm rain, with plenty of lightning as well.  Hershey was still working his wireless, and then he leaned over my shoulder and said the words that we had been dying to hear, \"I reached a ground station, and they would give us headings to fly\".  As I learned to appreciate, the British were ingenious at creating primitive systems to guide and rescue airmen in distress,I remember it vividly.  We were on a south course and had not seen the ground or sky for four or five hours, except for that time under the overcast.  On the south heading, believe it or not, we finally broke out in the clear.  The stars were shining overhead, the landscape below us was visible.  Directly below us, was a small landing strip, we peeled off quickly and landed.  I didn't know the British lighting system and there was a light line directly across the runway.  I assumed that was the first point of touchdown.  I learned later that that was the LAST point of touchdown.  I landed beyond that so no wonder, I had to stand on the brakes to get us stopped.\r\n\r\nYears later when I watched the Pope landing in a country for the first time, kneeling and kissing the ground.  I knew exactly what that kind of sensation produces.  There were ten of us who did exactly the same thing.  We had landed at a tiny RAF field in Ayr, which was Bobby Burns hometown.  We were the only airplane to get into a field in that area that night and we were weathered in for SEVEN FULL DAYS!!.  We could not get out and there was no air activity because the weather was so bad.  On the eighth day a bomber from the 44th Bomb Group came up and led us and a few others to the 14th Combat Wing to which we were all assigned.\r\n\r\nOur first mission was November 18, 1943, the target, a Fochwolfe factory in Norway about 50 plus miles north of Oslo.  The route was 750 miles all directly over the North Sea.  We flew a loose formation all the way, tightening up a bit as we passed the coast of Norway.  From there we flew north of Oslo, bombed the target, turned and headed south to Sea.\r\n\r\nSince I had been working the throttles pretty good in the ragged formation on the way up, and since we were also having super charger trouble, I was uneasy about how much fuel we had remaining.  I asked Vickers, our Engineer, \"How many gallons?\"  He said, \"700\".  \"Seven hundred\", I yelled, \"that's impossible!  We started up with 2700 gallons and now we've just got 700 to get home\".  \"Well\", said Vickers, \" gauges are kind of hard to read but maybe we have 750 gallons left\".  Well, what the hell to do.  How could we ever get back so far on so little?  I asked Callaway for a heading to the nearest airfield in Sweden.  As I recall it, we were very close to the Swedish border.  He checked and gave a heading to an airport which was about 75 to 100 miles away.  I thought and prayed.  I got everybody on the intercom and we talked.  Our first mission--Sweden meant internment for the balance of the war; hell, we wouldn't get any mail from home and the scavengers would steal all of our personal things at the base.  We were unanimous.  LETS GO FOR IT!!\r\n\r\nClearly we could not stay with the formation, so I throttled back and we began to fall behind.  About this time we passed over the coast.  Suddenly I saw streams of colored lights, all rising from below.  I dropped the left wing and look down.  There, about seven thousand feet below us were several gun boats.  They were firing bullets and they were intended for us.  So we got out of there as quickly as we could.  We headed south, southwest over a body of water called the Skagerrak and picked up a heading for home.  The weather was clear, the visibility was excellent.  I leaned out the gas mixture so far as I dared, so that we were mushing along nose high at about 135 to 140 miles an hour.  We relaxed and talked and about every two minutes asked Vickers for a reading on the sight gauges.  So it went for about an hour, then someone yelled on the intercom \"Fighters at 7 o'clock high!\" I knew that they were German, but from where did they come?  That is when I learned a geography lesson I've never forgotten.  The water between the Danish peninsula and the south coast of Norway is called Skagerrak.  I think that at the narrowest point it is about 100 miles wide.  We had to pass between the two points.  They jumped us, the straggler low on fuel and almost a cripple.  We were a natural  target.  We wanted out of the area as soon as possible, but the more speed we made the more fuel we consumed.  We played hide and seek with the Germans as they made passes and fired at us.  When they came in from the front, we turned into them and whenever possible we turned into the nearest friendly cloud.  So it went for 30 minutes.  Eventually, the fighters had to turn for home; they also had fuel problems.  We continued on looking at the cold, cold sea and the sight gauges.\r\n\r\nWe then threw overboard everyhing that was loose or that the crew could pry loose from the aircraft except the crew and our parachutes, and we PRAYED! At long last we saw the British coast on the horizon.  It was nearly dark and as we approached the field we saw British bombers taking off.  I later learned that this was the first time that the British had bombed Berlin and the planes taking off were part of that attack.  We fired flares.  The British gave way and we landed.  Vickers made his regular check of the remaining fuel supply.  Following the usual practice he put the calibrated dip stick in every tank.  In every tank the dip stick came up dry.  Thank you God, AMEN!  The RAF gave us dinner, bed and fuel.  But most of all they lent us a runway.  Next day we flew home to Shipdham.  \r\n\r\nWelcome to the ETO.  I wondered if the next 24 were going to be like this.",

Next we flew to Prestwick, Scotland, then to Valley, Wales. Our plane was taken from us and we went by train to Stone, England.  From there flew to Clintoe, Ireland, then on to Shipdham.",
    "bioTripDetails": "I was drafted in November 1941 and assigned to an Anti-Aircraft Battery.  It goes without saying, the country was totally unprepared for war (which came on December 7, 1941)  Our operation was totally secret, and it amounted to patrolling the Atlantic coast.  I was based in Washingon D.C., and served ten months on active duty before being assigned to Scott Field for Radio School, later to a crew and on to the ETO.\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed that experience.  In fact, I enjoyed all my service experience, except when the Germans were shooting at us.\r\n\r\nOn June 6, 1944 we were waked at 2:00 AM with shouts \"The Invasion is On\".  Our \r\nfirst mission was July 6, 1944   A bomber assembly plant, at Bernburg, Germany,it was our worst mission.  Approximately 60 planes abreast came at us from l:00 o'clock.  There were 200 holes in the plane when we got back, but the crew was totally intact.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne memorable mission was over Munich, July 21, 1944.  We had to make a second run as a formation of B-17's were making their run exactly opposite to ours.  After the second run, we still had our bombs.  We dived into a cloud bank and when we emerged we were totally alone and low on gas.  I got a radio fix, we opened the bombbay doors and dropped the bombs, then headed to Shipdham.  We landed with 15 gals. of gas left in each engine.\r\n\r\nOn August 5, 1944 our target was Brunswick, Germany.  Visibility was unlimited, not a cloud in the sky, but you couldn't see the bombers ahead for the flak.  More than any target we'd hit so far, I've never felt the concussion as I did that day.  When we opened the bombbay doors, the flaps on my helmet were rising and falling with the concussion of the explosions (I never fastened my chin straps).  One shell tore several holes in our bombbay, knocked out the hydraulic system.  The doors closed on what fluid remained, sparing us the trouble of the trouble of cranking them closed.  When we reached the Channel and dropped to a lower altitude, Woodie and I went back to the bombay and found the hydraulic lines were full of holes.  Woodie cranked the landing gear down for us to land.  After we landed we learned that flak had hit the #2 engine and crushed the exhaust pipe about 15\", but did not enter the engine.\r\n\r\nI have the greatest admiration for the English people, many of their characteristics amazed me, as we likewise probably amazed them.  They were ploddingly slow at their work but their courage and stamina were admirable.  When an air raid signal sounded, American servicemen went into an air raid shelter.  English people continued to sit around drinking tea, as though nothing was happening.  I was also touched to see English children raiding our garbage cans to eat our discarded food.  Some children 12-13 years old had never seen an orange.  We liked their Fish and Chips.  Perry brought them to me from town wrapped in a newspaper.\r\n\r\nLooking back, I feel the Beiber Crew was charmed.  I am proud to have served the greatest of all nations and grateful I flew with the greatest of all Crews.",

    "bioTripDetails": "January 3, 1944- SPAM AGAIN!  Its taste has reached the \"awful disgusting stage\"!  I worry about my folks and their worries over me, but my prayers with theirs, should keep me in good hands.  and there is Helen's too.  I felt wonderfully protected.\r\n\r\nAfter six missions I was assigned from the 392nd to the H2X Pathfinder (over cloud) Navigation/Bombing Training Center, 482nd Bomb Group, Alconbury, England (near Cambridge).  On completion of the training I was assigned to the 44th Bomb Group, 14th Combat Wing, Shipdham, England, and to the Lead Crew of Captain \"Mac\" McCormick.  In my experience Mac was the finest person both personally and as a Lead Pilot to which I could have been assigned.  After he completed his 30 missions, I was pleased to fly as Lead PFF Navigator with other fine Lead Pilots.\r\n\r\nIt was Mac who was chosen as Lead Pilot of the 14th Combat Wing on \"D-Day\" with General Leon Johnson on board.  It was totally overcast.  Now looking back, I know the lead seconds that we were given were too many, and 2 seconds would have been sufficient.  The shore line stood out sharp on the scope, but in this I never knew how strung out we were, hopefully none.  More time, too, should have been devoted to the release procedure automatic or visual, if possible, sighting on our lead plane.  This key factor was not mentioned in the briefing as I recall, only the warning -  DO NOT DROP SHORT.\r\n\r\nI remember the 200th Mission Party held at the 44th BG at Shipdham.  On that day the 14th Combat Wing Commander, General Leon Johnson had decreed that for that day, the officers would honor the enlsited men by removing their officer insignia, and if any officer was caught with his on he would be dealt with  by being thrown in the Base Duck Pond. What a fun day.  I can't believe it really happened!  Maybe after all these years it is only a dream!!\r\n\r\nAbout noon, General Johnson drove up into the center of the station, AS THE CHAUFFEUR with his Sergeant (driver) sitting in the back seat smoking a big cigar.  As the General got out to open the back door for the Sergeant, someone noticed there was one star left on the General's shirt.  They were all laughing along with the General and shouted \" To the Duck Pond\", and with a neat toss he sailed in with a splash.  He came out laughing and I believe everyone clapped and sang \"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow\". \r\n\r\nI was aboard many aircraft but I do not recall a single name.  I did not have any aircraft lost to the point of being in need of ditching.  Many of the planes had flak or fighter damage, especially flak.  I was amazed, while bombing a site in the Potsdam RR Marshalling Yards(06-24-1944) near Berlin,  the flak seemed thick like smoke about 5000 feet below our plane.  Over some sites like the Ruhr Valley, the anti-aircraft explosions were so close that our planes would rock and bounce.\r\n\r\nI often think of the combat crews and how young they were, average age, my guess 21 or less.  My own more like 26.  Whether they wanted to or not they flew.  They did not show any signs of shirking nor seeking any excuse not to go, as they listened to the briefings on the target or targets for the day. These targets were often terrible targets to fly into, the Ruhr Valley (the industrial center of Nazi Germany), to Frankfort, Wesermonde, Munich, Schweinfurt, Berlin, to aircraft factories, huge rail yards, over flak batteries, through the home land of the Luftwaffe.\r\n\r\nI have seen the American Cemetaries at Cambridge, England and in Normany, France and Belgium; name after name of America's finest , so many in their 20's (some older) with their home town addresses from all over the United States.\r\n\r\nOn my return to the US, I visited Malvern, Iowa, the home of Capt. McCormick, Lead Pilot, 66th Sqdn.  My first lead pilot until he completed his mission.  To my sorrow, I found out that one of his stateside assignments was ferrying Distinguished Officers and Visitors.  His last assignment ended in crashing into a cloud covered mountain in South America.  One of the higher ranking officers was at the controls.  Burial was in Arlington.",

The 44h was putting up 24 ships for the mission.  A few of the crew members on 48 hour passes managed to get back to Shipdham before take off but were too late to be considered for the raid.  One of them was Major Howard \"Pappy\" Moore. The regular crew were re-assigned for the Kiel mission.  I was Suzy \"Q\"s usual co-pilot but took the pilots seat aboard Miss Delores, a new Liberator which had sat at dispersal for some time.  Lieutenant Hartley \"Hap\" Westbrook would fly co-pilot.\r\n\r\nCaptain Bob Bishop, the navigator, plus seven others, all from the Suzy Q , completed the scratch crew of Miss Delores or Q for Queenie as it was known because of her call letter, Gilbert \"Gibby\" Wandtke, the engineer, was not happy about the change in aircraft. He had been jilted by a Delores in the States and claimed Miss Delores would probably take them over the target but would not bring them back!\r\n\r\nWe were shot down on this mission after bombing France and Germany.

    "bioTripDetails": "I have written four volumes on my career in the US Army Air Force.  The following stories and account of one combat mission with the 8th AF were taken from these volumes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   ARRIVAL IN THE ETO MARCH, 1944\r\n\r\nAfter having flown the South Atlantic route from the United States (ZO1), we landed March 7,1944 in Wales.  Within 48 hours we were transferred to Qulanto in Northern Ireland, South of Belfast.  This was a pre-combat orientation, theater indoctrination and combat assignment training base.  Our stay was six weeks of duration before going on to England.  All officers were warned to guard their .45 pistol with their lives or we would be court martialed if we let one of the IRA members steal it.  I attended  navigation class and was trained to use the Gee Box which was a short range Loran but very very accurate in locating ones position anywhere in the British Isles.  This navigational aid used computations based on the time lag in signals received from two widely spaced transmitting stations to give an exact position.  Later when I became a lead navigator and squadron navigator, our Plane \"Lily Marlene\" was especially equipped for my navigation with the Gee Box.\r\n\r\nOne day we were told we could expect an inspection by none other than General James Doolittle, himself.  The same General who lead the famous B-25 raid over Tokyo in 1942.  We were told to be at our training area and to act as if we did not expect an inspection.  I was at my Gee Box training desk, about every 10 minutes and then 5 minutes, then 2 minutes and finally a minute, someone would stick his head in the door to announce where the General was and when to expect him.  Of course, we all looked like hard working trainees when General Doolittle did arrive. He stepped in the door, our instructor bellowed out, \"Attention\".  The General walked slowly around the room, asking a question or two concerning our training.  Finally he reached my position, he stopped with his face not 12 inches from mine, looked me right in the eyes but never said a work.  Need I say we got very little training in that day.\r\n\r\nThe base was on the south side of a large lake, Belfast was on the north side. The Irish people liked to sail on the lake.  One of our boyish tricks was to fly our B-54 bomber low over the water and buzz the sail boats.  We thought it was great sport to blow the boats over with our prop wash.  I suspect the Irish boaters thought otherwise. Anyway they looked mad.\r\n\r\nMost of the orientation lectures draw a blank in my memory, they were generally on what to expect when we joined our Combat Group or how to keep good relations with our English hosts.  One lecture was on the evils of V.D.  This was a Flight Surgeon giving the talk who said flat out, avoid all sex.  He paused, then said, \"Now after you've done it, here is how to use your profolactics\".\r\n\r\nThe lecture that stands out was the one concerning the number of combat missions required to complete one's tour of combat duty.  Some fool stood up and asked what were the odds.  The lecturer responded thusly, \"On an verage, mission after mission flying against the Nazi fortress of Europe, the 8th Air Force lost four out of every hundred planes, ie.4%.  Of course some would be \"milk runs\" with no loss but others would be a disaster due to very aggressive enemy action\".  He reasoned, a crew that flies 25 missions has a 100% chance of being shot down on their last mission.  A great quiet fell over the room.  For many including myself, this was the first time it had dawned on us we were not playing for marbles. Someone could get hurt.  Up to now, we were just big boys playing with expensive toys, not a care in the world nor a thought of danger.  This was a sobering  thought, how can anyone expect to survive such odds?  Our speaker quickly added that in reality many would go on to complete their tour due to the laws of probability.  I estimated later that one third would.  Our crew kept a record of the 18 crews that trained together and came overseas together.  Sure enough, six of us completed the tour which was raised to 30 missions by them.\r\n\r\nWe lived in Nissen huts which held about 16 officers each.  The front door was inset so a bunk would just fit between the door inset and the rounded walls.  I slept in one of these bunks.  There was a pot belly stove in the center of the building.  On our way over the South Atlantic, our bombadier, John Warga, bought a 5 gallon wooden barrel of whisky while we were in Fortalaga, Brazil.  Warga and our belly gunner, C. J. Alexander ( who we all called Swoose after the popular song of the day \"Alexander the Swoose\") were the whiskey drinkers in our crew but even they could not drink the Brazilian rot gut as it was too strong.  The only thing it was fit for was to start the coal fire in the stove, it must have been 500 proof as it was as effective as gasoline.\r\n\r\nI went to bed early one evening as we had a navigational training flight out over the North Atlantic in the morning at day break.  I needed rest as did Charles Peritti, our pilot, for the lond, difficult and dangerous flight.  I had just gotten to sheep when bombardier Warga and some of his drinking buddies came into the hut after a night out on the town.  Needless to say, they were loaded and noisy.  Those of us trying to sleep asked them to leave so we could rest.  Instead Warga broke out his keg of Brazilian whiskey and they all started drinking it.  Before long, the lot of them had literally gone wild.  I got out of bed and tried to reason with them.  Getting back in bed I yelled at them to shut up and let us get some rest.  This was a big mistake on my part as all reason had left them.  One of the guys picked up the keg of whiskey and held it over my head.  I pulled the covers over my face and he said if I opened my mouth once more he would pour the whiskey on me and set it afire.  I believed him as the whole lot were crazy.  Not another word did they hear from me, I was really scared.\r\n\r\nFinally, Warga and his buddies left to go to the adjacent hut.  They were making a terrible noise by this time.  The men in the next hut were not as kind to this wild bunch as we had been.  A fight broke out and Warga, who was as strong as an ox, picked upa steel cot and threw it the whole length of the Nissen hut.  They forced every one out but Warga who kept pressing against the door as they pushed him out.  Some how his head became wedged between the door and the frame with several men pushing against the door.  One of the guys picked up a baseball bat and began to beat him senseless.\r\n\r\nThe MP's came and arrested the rowdy lot.  Warga was unconscious so they took him to the hospital.  We did fly the mission the next day.  The date was April 6th in a B-214 H, but I had never been so tired.  When we got back, we went to the hospital to visit Warga.  He was a mess.  We could not recognize him as his head was all bandaged and his face swollen and distorted out of shape, especially his eyes.  He spent several days in the hospital and informed me he would be court-martialed.  Everytime we visited him, I would ask if he wanted another drink of Brazilian whiskey.  Just the mention of the stuff would make him shudder.  Not only had he been hurt physically but he had gotten deathly ill from the consumption of that devilish brew.\r\n\r\nWarga was never court-martialed.  We received orders to proceed to England for combat duty.  Since we were leaving soon, the base commander felt Warga had suffered enough for his indiscretion, all charges were dismissed.  We took the keg of Brazilian whiskey to England with us and continued to use it to light fires.  It sat on a shelf in full view of Warga but never again did he think of touching a drop.  Needless to say, we never let him forget the event as long as the whiskey lasted.\r\n\r\nWhile in Northern Ireland, the crew went to Belfast twice.  We rode the train and also a double decker bus.  On one trip I left my Kodak box camera on the bus seat when we got off.  When I realized what I had done, I ran to the next stop and retrieved my camera.  I was the only member of the crew with any way to record our experiences in photo form and I took many, many pictures later at our combat base that nothing else could have duplicated.\r\n\r\nIn Belfast, we had our first experience at a British dance hall.  The floor was very large with several hundred couples dancing.  Where as Americans dance in a small area of the floor, maybe getting around the whole floor once to a dance number, the British move fast, almost run, with the whole floor of couples moving like a wheel.  They did not seem to like to talk much or carry on a conversation like American couples.  However, they will all burst out in song if a catchy tune gets their attention.  This was our first experience of a mixed group singing a song that to us seemed a little off color in mixed company.  The title was \"Roll Me Over in the Clover.\"  It went thusly:\r\n                                                    \r\n                                                            Now this is number one\r\n                                                            and the fun has just begun\r\n                                                            Roll me over, lay me down\r\n                                                            and do it again\r\n                                                            Roll me over, in the clover\r\n                                                            Roll me over, lay me down\r\n                                                            and do it again\r\n\r\nThe second verse started out, \"Now this is number two, what ever shall I do\" etc.  Same with numbers three and four and five and infinitum with some of the verses being very risque.\r\n\r\n                          INCIDENT BETWEEN MISSION NO. 1 AND NO.3  APRIL 23, 1944\r\n\r\nThere were four mess halls at Shipdham Air Base, home for the 44th Bomb Group.  A combat officers and enlisted mens mess and non-combat officers and enlisted mens mess.  No combat mission was flown on April 23rd as we had ground training exercises.  That evening we went to supper, I along with other combat officers ate at our \"Combat Officers Mess\".  We had not been back in the squadron area long before I began to fell faint.  I was th first to become sick so I got a lot of attention.  Medics were called in as I was violently ill.  They rushed me to the base hospital and I was one of the first to be admitted.  I can remember being placed on a hospital bed and at least three or four doctors and orderlies helping me.  The special attention did not last long as the hospital quickly filled to overflow capacity.  Dozens of flying officers began to arrive and soon ther was no place to put them except on the floor.  They were all as sick as myself and complete bedlam and pandemonium broke loose. Needless to say, there was a \"mess\" everywhere.  I did not know at the time we had contacted Ptomaine poisoning from a certain pie served for dessert.\r\n\r\nA new patient was carried in and placed on the floor next to me.  I looked and could not believe my eyes.  The victim was none other than our Group Commander, Colonel John H. Gibson.  I know it sounds strange to anyone who has not experienced it but in war time respect for rank and authority is absolute.  I could not imagine the hospital staff placing Colonel Gibson on the floor while I, a junior officer, lay on a bed.  I spoke up and requested they put him on the bed and let me go on the floor.  Colonel Gibson would have no part of it, he said to me, \"You were here first and you stay on the bed\".  Fortunately, I got well enough to vacate my bed as I was first in and first out.  I got a case of the \"GI's\" two other times during the war and in each case, I was first to become sick and first to recover but neither of these illnesses was as severe as this ptomaine poisoning.\r\n\r\nAs a result of so many combat officers being stricken and the severity of the illness, the missions of the 24th and 25th were scrubbed.  The group did fly to Germany on April 26th and I flew my second mission to Chalons-Sur-Marne on the afternoon of the 27th.\r\n\r\nForty years after this event, I was talking to General Gibson and his wife, Ruth. The occassion was the \"44th Heritage Memorial Group Reunion\" in May 1984 at Dayton, Ohio.  I told the General and Mrs. Gibson my version ofthe event and when I came to the part where the then Colonel Gibson would not let me give him the bed she said, \"It sounds just like John\".  I was also surprised to find out that General Gibson is only 12 years older than myself.  I was 21 years old in April 1944 which means Colonel Gibson was only 33.  All these years since the war I had imagined him to be much older because at the time in 1944, Colonel Gibson was in my minds eye like \"The All Mighty\".\r\n\r\n                               MISSION NO.3 TO BERLIN - APRIL 29, 1944\r\n\r\nToday was to be my third combat mission.  It was Saturday, April 29, 1944.  The first two were not too rough and we were a little too complacent.  At this time, I was not a lead navigator,therefore, not privileged to advance reports as to what the days mission was to be for the 8th Air Force's heavy bombers.\r\n\r\nAfter stumbling through the blackout to the breakfast that morning, the usual question was on everyone's lips, \"Where are we going today\"?  Was it going to be a \"milk run\" over the coast of France or a deep penetration to the heart of Germany?  As we filed into the large Nissen hut used for briefing, the men gathered together, as crews, sitting facing a stage with a huge map of western Europe above it.  Suddenly the command, \"Attention\", was sounded.  In unison, all snapped to their feet and in walked the Commanding Officer, Col. John H. Gibson, and his staff.  The briefing officer stepped forward with a long pointer and the map curtains were quickly drawn open.  At this movement, we all knew what our target was for the day, the ribbons pinned to the map led straight to the heart of Hitler's Germany, the \"Big B\" Berlin.  The howl and commotion could have been heard a block away.        \r\n\r\nFinally, everyone settled down and the briefing officers proceeded to detail our objectives.  The predicted weather, the expected fighter opposition and flak concentrations were outlined.  The various pilots were assigned positions in each section of each squadron of the group.  Some were to lead, others were to be wing men, some were assigned high and others low positions in the formation.  And, of course, someone had to fly coffin corner, low left rear with the least protection from the guns of the fellow planes in the formation.\r\n\r\nThe pilots, bombardiers, navigator, flight engineers, radio men and gunners all went to their own briefing for further details and instructions pretaining to their specific duties.  The pilot was in command of the ship but the success of every mission depended on close teamwork.  No one man, crew, flight squadron, group or Division did it all.  In toto, we were a powerful Air Force out to do battle with a determined enemy.  Our objective was to do maximum damage to today's target.  Theirs was to prevent us from reaching the target or to inflict such painful punishment that we would cease trying.  The stage was set, the battle would soon begin.  Hundreds of men would be either killed, wounded, or missing this day but nothing could stop the mission once it had been set in motion.\r\n\r\nBriefing over, we gathered as crews to be taken by truck out to our planes.  At this time, our crew flew whatever plane was assigned. (Later after we became a lead crew and I a lead navigator, we were assigned a special plane with special navigation equipment, 260 P \"Lili Marlene\")  Now became an extremely tense period before each mission. We would busy ourselves preparing for flight, each man checking what pertained to him.  At the same time, we kept an eye on the tower. The reason being that if the mission for the day was aborted, a certain colored flare would be sent aloft but if it were \"Go\", a differnt flare color was used, I think it was red but it may have been white as my memory fails me after 40 years.  Today, the mission was go, the engines were started and we mounted the plane.  The moment of truth was at hand, there was no option but to go and only God knew who would return.\r\n\r\nOn both take off and landing, I vacated my forward navigation compartment to stand behind the pilot.  I would hold on to a steel protection plate at his back.  This gave me an excellent view of take off and landing.  If a crash situation were to develop, I was to sit on the floor with my back to the steel plate, my knees pulled up and my hands behind my head which I would brace also against the steel bulkhead.  (Fortunately I only had need for this once when coming back from Berlin on my 21st mission, our hydraulic system to the nose wheel was shot out and we skidded nose first down the runway badly damaging the bomb sight and navigation compartment).\r\n\r\nThe 44th sent 21 planes up this day with no aborts.  Now came one of the most frightening parts of every sortie.  As I stood behind the pilot, Lt. Peritti, he would work our way down a long cue of bombers until it was our turn to take off.  He would go through his check list and he and co-pilot Lt. Palmer would shove all four throttles full forward.  Ever so slowly, we would accelerate but at the same time eating up runway.  The plane would be loaded with 2700 gallons of hi-octane gasoline and 6 to 8000 pounds of high explosives and incendiaries.  At lift off speed Peritti would pull back on the stick and we would be airborne but just barely.  Still just off the ground and gaining altitude slowly, I could see the trees at the end of the runway getting closer and closer.  At no time did I ever learn not to be apprehensive and actually frightened.  Somehow we always made it by inches over the trees, I believe by defying all laws of physics and gravity.\r\n\r\nAssembly  was an exacting and demanding task both in piloting and navigation.  First by two and threes and finally by squadrons, all the planes came together to form a group of approximately 21 to 36 planes.  The lead navigators job was to have us over a designated spot at a specific zero time headed in the right direction.  In this manner we formed squadrons into groups, groups into wings, wings into Air Divisions and Air Divisions into the Mighty Eighth Air Force. From beginning to end, we would extend over 100 miles in a straight line through the sky.  With the contrails forming at the wing tip of hundreds of planes, the beauty of the sight would have to be seen to be comprehended.\r\n\r\nIt was 0730 hours and we were off to Berlin.  According to \"Stars and Stripes\", our ETO Newspaper, this was the heaviest daylight assault in history on any one target.  The Force was made up of 600 four motor bombers carrying almost l500 tons of explosives and incendaries.  We were escorted by another 814 fighters, P-5l Mustangs, P-47 Thunderbolts and P-38 Lightnings.  But the Germans were ready with some of the heaviest opposition encountered to date on daylight operations.  One wing alone reported being attacked by at least 200 Nazi fighters.  The Germans used ME 109's and FW 190's as their principle fighters, sometimes ME 210's.\r\n\r\nThe resisance met by the various elements of the massive bomber fleet varied widely.  Fortunately the 44th Bomb Group was well known by the Luftwaffe pilots as being a seasoned combat outfit and best let alone as long as there were less experienced groups that would be an easier target.  A number of German intercepters did test us however, approximately 30 on the way to Berlin and 40 to 50 on the way out.  My most vivid memory of the war was burned on my mind when we were approximtely halfway to Berlin.  I can still close my eyes and after forty years see it again and will until death takes the last light from my sight.\r\n\r\nWhat I am about to record sounds so incredible that I blame no one who wishes to disbelieve.  As God is my witness, I tell the truth.  Over my ear phones came the voice of Paul Corlew, our engineer and top turret gunner, \"Fighters high at One O'Clock\".  I looked out of my astro-dome and saw three German fighters circling.  One could almost hear the lead Nazi pilot say, \"Watch me boys, I'll show you how it is done\". He peeled off into a wide arc so he was at an altitude headed straight for our formation.  At this, I switched positions so I could look out of my right bubble window which afforded and excellent view forward, down and to the whole right of our line of flight.  As the interceptor flew towards us, be began to slow roll.  I became very fearful as I was looking down his two 20mm wing cannons and with each burst, I saw the orange-red flash of the guns.  He appeared to be aimed directly at me and I could not help but wonder where the shells were going.  I fully expected the next one to explode in my navigation compartment.  I was extremently fearful and yet spellbound at the same time.\r\n\r\nBut what followed the next second or so really put fear into me.  As the scoundrel slow rolled towards us, closing at rapid speed, I really became upset.  It appeared to me that he was going to crash into our plane with a head on collision.  I was petrified with fear.  Then suddenly the pilot lifted his wings in a vertical position so he could slice between our right wing tip, he just missed it by inches.\r\n\r\nAn awesome sight caught my attention.  At the base of the wing of the adjacent plane, right at the inboard motor and fuselage, a large ball of orange flame exploded before my eyes.  The whole left wing peeled off and to me, it seemed like an eternity that the plane stood there as if it were flying.  I knew it could have only been a few micro-seconds but the vision is burned in my memory like a still photograph. Then in a flash the plane flipped over on its back as the right wing was still flying.  It wasa violent motion that skewered the whole axis of flight.  At this point, I hesitate to record what I saw next as it is too bizzare to be believable.  Try to accept my version as the truth.  Believe what you will but I'll tell it exactly as I remember what I saw.\r\n\r\nAs the plane flipped, the force of the action catapulted the waist gunner on the right side out of the gun opening and towards our plane.  The arc of his flight thru the air put him towards our right wing and he fell between where I was standing at my bubble window and our right inboard motor.  He did have a parachute. He wore only a harness with two nipples.  (I also had the same type chest pac parachute harness.  My parachute was on the floor by my feet.  We had been instructed that if for some reason you did not have time to snap the chest pac on the nipples of the harness, then just grab your chute, jump out with it in your hand and snap it on as you fall through the air).\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, this unfortunate waist gunner had no such opportunity to grab his parachute before he was thrown through the window.  As he passed me, at most only a few feet away, he was kicking both feet and grabbing the air with his hands in desperation.  Maybe he thought he could grasp our plane in some way to hold on.  I watched him plummet towards the ground until my attention went to the wreck of the one winged B-24 Liberator falling through the sky.  It was cart wheeling nose over tail over the one wing in a  huge windmill spinning motion.  All of the other nine men were trapped due to centrifugal force in the plane with no hope whatsoever I thought.  Will Lundy  reports the plane was A/C #42-29471X piloted by 2nd Lt. G. H. Sweigart and that three men did survive to become POW's.  My eyes were glued to this action as I watched the wreck tumble end over end forat least 10,000 feet.\r\n\r\nI had lost all track of time or anything else that was going on around me when I heard on my helmet earphones, \"Second fighter coming in\".  I looked up and saw a second aircraft repeating what his leader had done.\r\n\r\nAt this point, my mind goes blank, I cannot remember anything about the second or third fighters as they attacked the formation.  I suspect I was too absorbed in my own thoughts and fears.\r\n\r\nAt some point in time, I again came back to reality as I remember our approach to the City of Berlin.  The flak was intense.  The Nazi defenders had 520 anti-aircraft guns trained in a 20 mile arc on us.  The sky was one huge black cloud of explording metal.  The guns fired in batteries of four or so it seemed to me.  When it was bursting at some altitude other than our own, we had little to fear but as soon as they zeroed in, trouble was at hand.  I never did get over the fright of seeing a flak burst right in front of us, then a second a little closer and a third even closer yet.  With each burst, the plane would almost instantly fly through the black cloud.  One could easily sense the cordite smell.  At this point, you knew the next burst would be directly behind the tail.  \r\n\r\nYou note, I said \"With Gods Help\".  This mission was the first time I can remember praying out loud for God to let me live through the battle.  I asked him to let me survive the day.  I promised I'd do anything he asked of me if only he would spare me.  Here I am forty years later and I must admit I have a bit of a guilty conscience when I think back on my promises.  Like all men, the flesh is weak when the danger is past.  Yet, somehow, I feel I hve been a better person for having experienced these strong emotions.\r\n\r\nMany planes went down, I can especially remember one of our planes sliding off to the side in a rather steep dive.  I heard later it was because they had lost their oxygen supply and had flown low level back to base.  We did survive the flak barrage somehow and headed back to England but our troubles were not over by a long shot.  We turned into a 100 knot headwind.  Our indicated air speed was about 165 mph. and at 25,000 feet and as cold as it was (60 degrees below zero our true air speed was over 200 mph.  However with a headwind, our ground speed was something just over 100 mph. Talk about etrnity, this was it, we had 600 miles to go and it would take hours at the ground speed we were flying.  Our fighter escort had turned back due to fuel consumption.\r\n\r\nMany planes were damaged and just would have made it home under the best of conditions but with the delay caused by this strong head wind, somejust could notmake it.  I don't know how many planes I saw go down that day on the way to target, over the city and on the way home!  I know it was a great many.  I saw some explode, others trailing smoke, others with wings on fire and many many parachutes open as the crews bailed out.  But one sight stands out above all others on the wayhome.  As we crossed the North Sea, I began to see planesditching in the water, it was like watching a motion picture.  I was so detached from the action!   Some of the planes would glide to the most gentle stop and the men would climb onto the wings but others would hit a swell in the water and seem to divenose first in a crumpled heap.  It was obvious that almost no one could survive the shock.  British PT boats were on hand to pick up survivors.\r\n\r\nThis was one of the worst days ever for the Eighth Air Force as we had lost 63 four engine bombers and 13 fighters on this mision to \"Big B\" as we often called Berlin.  When we reached base and landed at 1730 hours (5:30 p.m.) I actually bent over and kissed the ground I wa so pleased to be back.  I had been in the air 8 hours and 15 minutes. This was my third mission, now I knew why we were told that if we flew 25 misions at an average of 4% loss per mission, that we had a 100% chance of being shot down.  (They raised it to 30 missions before Icompleted my tour just to be sure none of us made it and then I volunteered for a 31st against all current wisdom to never volunteer for anything).  I did survive the 31 missions and \"GOD WAS WITH ME!\r\n\r\nAfter my experience of seeing the man come out of the pane without a parachute, I had immediately reached down and snapped on my chest pac even though it was considerably in my way to work at my desk.\r\n\r\nWhen I turned in my parachute after the mission I asked to be issued a back-pac chute.  The orderly behind the desk asked what position I flew.  When I responded that I was a navigator, he said that navigators wore chest pacs. I had news for him and I cannot remember what or how I said it, but he issued me a back-pac without an argument.  Never again did I ever take off without my parachute on my back.  I even would flip up the corners to be sure the nylon was in place as rumor had it that some men had bailed out only to find an army blanket stuffed in the nylon's place. The story had it that some guys found it would influence their girl friends if they gave them some nylon.  I don't know how much truth was in the rumor but you can be sure I was not going to take the chance.\r\n\r\nAccording to the \"Mighty Eight War Diary\" by Roger A Freeman, a day to day operational record of the 8th AF, 679 B-17's and B-24's were dispatched of which 618 were effective.  We dropped 1498 tons of bombs. 63 bombers were MIA, three from the 44th Bomb Group, 2 interned, 432 damaged, 18 men were KIA, 38 WIA and 606 MIA.  (of 814 fighters dispactched, 13 were MIA).\r\n\r\nThis amounts to over 10% of the bomber-fleet, and over 77% ofall the effective bombers lost or damaged on this onemission.  I for one shall never forget that day and like every mission I ever had in combat, I flew it twice.  Once in reality and again that night in my dreams.  I relived in vivid detail every event and emotion that I had experienced.  One of our enlisted men actually \"bailed out\" of his top bunk several times while dreaming.\r\n\r\nADDENDUM TO MISSION #3 TO BERLIN APRIL 29, 1954.\r\n\r\nNew information has come to light concerning this mission.  Will Lundy (without whose support this book could never have been written) wrote in a letter to me dated 1/21/86, Quote \"I spent a couple of evenings lately going back through your missions to see if I could \"borrow\" some of your observations and experiences when we lost other planes.  With this casualty memorial that I am putting together I could use the words of observors tohelp put things into perspective along with the stories of the men who went down with their plane - but survived\".\r\n\r\nI was especially interested in your book about your mission when you saw the string of bombs exploding below one of our planes as well as the one where you saw the German e/a hit a plane next to your in your formation - 29 April 44.  But when I went to my file for my casualty memorial and tried to identify which plane it was, I ran into considerable problems as none of the stories told to me jibbed with your view.  No, I don't doubt for a minute that your story is true, but there is plenty of work to be done to identify that aircract, as it appears not to have been a 44th plane!  But I cannot identify which B-24 it was, but it was not a 44BG plane.  We lost two ships on the 29th - and crews, Glenn Sweigart and Keith Schuyler's - and Hruby ditched off the English coast.  Sweigart ells me that his ship had an engine (#3) lose oil pressure, then the prop ran away.  They lost altitude down to 9500 feet and were barely making it against the strong wind and skidding because of the windmilling prop.  Later, they were jumped by fighters and eventually were shot down.  So he couldn't have been in formation with you.  I think that this ship is the one that you thought was rammed by that FW.  The other plane lost was Keith Schuyler's. The navigator tells me that his ship was badly hit by flak and was unable to keep formation either.  They were jumped by fighters and they dove for cover in clouds at about 5,000 feet.  So this could not have been that plane either.\r\n\r\nHowever, Keith Scuyler in his \"Elusive Horizons\" states, \"A B-24 that had been lagging at seven o'clock drew in close at five o'clock just as a German (e/a) came through.  The fighter smashed headon into the big one right at the nose turret (could have been the left wing?) and both planes explosed in a ball of flame.  Then it was over, just like that. But back through the formations behind us the Germans barreled with reckless abandon. Airplanes were going down in every direction, the cripples staggering out of formation, clinging to life - then blowing up or fluttering down out of sight\".\r\n\r\nSo possibly this plane that moved into the formation was not a 44 BG plane at all. In fact, it couldn't have been or we'd have lost three planes instead of two.  I tried to buy one of Keith's books but he is all sold out\"  End of quote.\r\n\r\nI replied in a letter dated 1/16/86.  Quote:  \"Dear Will, thank you for your very informative letter of 1/21/86.  No one can deny your first hand reports by Glenn Sweigart and Keith Schuyler as they were on board the only two planes of the 44th who were shot down over Germany.  Roger A. Freeman's book \"The mighty Eight War Diary\" also states on page 232 that the 44th only lost two planes that day in addition to one ditched.\r\n\r\nThe first hand evidence you have of men who were aboard these two pllanes, gives me reason to believe that you were correct in saying the plane I saw go down was not a 44th.  What I saw was exactly as I wrote in my diary of that day.  It was only our 3rd mission and we were far back in the formation, where I do not know.  It had never dawned on me to suspect that the plane was not part of our formation.  It was not rammed by the by the German fighter as I saw the wing explode before or at the instant the fighter passed me.  I looked the German pilot in the face as he just missed our wing tip.  He did not touch the Liberator with his plane.  The B-24 wing came off from an explosion in the wing tanks.\r\n\r\nIt's likely that Keith Schuyler and I saw the same thing but at different prospectives and he thought the fighter had hit the B-24.  It appears to me that the plane I saw go down must have been the one he saw pull up at five o'clock.  We were on the right side of the formation, I was so engrossed in watching the fighter come at us, I could have easily missed a B-24 pulling up next to us.  I did not notice the plane at all until I jerked my head to watch the fighter go by, then I saw the wing explode.  I was looking directly at it.\r\n\r\nI know no will believe that a man flew through the air and just missed by bubble window but it is the truth.  I saw it with my own eyes, I'll never forget.\r\n\r\nThank you for this new propective you have put on this episode of my life.\"  End of Quote.\r\n\r\nI'm sure more information will come to light as others read this.  I will pass it along as it does.\r\n\r\nI flew 31 missions from April to October 1944.  Volume two of my four books describe in great detail my experiences while in combat.",

After stateside training at Grenier Field, NH, the crew deployed their newly named \"Little Beaver\" for England on October 4, 1942.\r\n\r\nI remained on the Phillips crew through the terrible months of February, March and April when the daylight bombing attrition decimated the 44h Bomb Group; especially the 67th Squadron.  Of the original roster of Pilots and Co-Pilots their losses were:  Major Donald W. MacDonald, Squadron Commander and Command Pilot shot down with Captain Art Cullen on the 15 Feb. raid on Dunkirk Harbor to sink the German Radar Ship TOJO; Lts. Rufus Oliphant and Co-Pilot Charles Wilkes, also lost over Dunkirk;  Lt. J. B. Long and Co-Pilot Lt. John McCormick killed in a mid-air collision with a 66th Squadron aircraft on the 16 of Feb. raid on St. Nazaire;  Lts. Clyde Price and Co-Pilot Robert E. Forrest, alongwith Lts. Robert W. Blaine and Co-Pilot Lawrence J. Roetto were simultaneously shot down on the bomb run over Rouen, France on March 8.\r\n\r\nThe \"Little Beaver\" flew on each of these tough missions including the TOJO raid.  By the 8th of March 1943 raid on Rouen, the 67th had lost five of its original nine crews.  By the 22nd of March the 67th was down to three aircraft and crews, \"Suzy Q\". \"Little Beaver\"and the new \"Annie Oakley\" (Lt. Williams A. Roach, Jr. has just arrived with his new airplane).\r\n\r\nCalling on experienced co-pilots to bolster the force, I quickly soloed in the \"Beaver\".  With an American transfer from the RAF, Lt. Bill Dabney as Co-Pilot, a new crew was formed and assigned a newly arrived aircraft, which was promptly named \"Buzzin Bear\" (as I was a product of UC Berkley, The Golden Bears).\r\n\r\nAs a small way of celebrating the formation of the new crew, we were granted a three day pass. We went to London.  Upon returning to the base in the early morning hours of 14 May, we learned that the Group was preparing for a mision launch against the Krupp Submarine Works in Kiel, Germany.  It was a maximum effort mission but the 67th could muster only three crews. \"Suzy Q\" was being repaired, so the third crew to be piloted by Lt. Robert I Brown, Major Moore's Co-Pilot, on his first mission as Pilot, was forced to fly a replacement aircraft named \"Miss Delores\".  This aircraft had, to this point, a dubious record for completing missions.  The other aircraft and crews were, of course, Lt. Roach in \"Annie Oakley\" and \"George\" Phillips and Co-Pilot Lt. Everett W. Wilborn, Jr.   For the first mission the crew was to fly without my being in the right seat.  ALL THREE CREWS WERE LOST. Robert I Brown and Co-Pilot Harley A. Westbrook and five others bailed out and were captured.  Three Gunners in the waist and tail went down with the plane.  Hit directly by heavy flak right after target, Lts. Roach and Co-Pilot plus six of the crew were KIA, the Navigator and Bombadier successfully bailed out and were captured.  \"Little Beaver\" was hit directly under the flight deck at the same time as \"Annie Oakley\".  Phillips and Wilborn, along with five other crew were KIA, four others successfully bailed out and were captured. OF THE ORIGINAL 67TH PILOTS, NOW THERE WAS ONE!\r\n\r\nNewly promoted to lst Lieutenant, I flew my first mission as Pilot on April 4 in \"Little Beaver\" on a diversion mission along the Dutch Coast.  My second crew mission was over Brest, Germany in the new aircraft \"Buzzin Bear\".  Ed Mikoloski was my Navigator on this 16 May raid.  On May 17 and again on May 29, we flew missions to Bordeaux and La Pallice, France. All three missions were without losses and the post-Kiel mission morale took a sudden rise.  During June, the 44th flew low level practice missions over England and prepared for the Africa deployment on June 26.\r\n\r\nBetween \"warm-up\" raids against Italian targets of July 2,5,10 and 15 I flew low level training missions in preparation for Ploesti.  On June 17, we took \"Buzzin Bear\" to Naples.  Instead of the usual light defenses of the Italian targets, this day we encountered fierce fighter opposition comprised of both Italian and German E/A.  The \"Buzzin Bear\" crew wrote a page in history when during some thirty minutes of constant attack, they destroyed three Macci 202's, one ME 109 and one ME 110 all officially confirmed and no crew injuries.\r\n\r\nFor the first time the \"Buzzin Bear\" had damage on the #3 engine from a probably 20 mm hit that caused a loss of oil pressure and I was forced to feather #3.  At this point we began to drop behind the formation.  In addition to the #3 shutdown, we had high cylinder head temperatures from the high power settings attemptin to stay in formation. The high power settings with rich mixture in attempts to keep the engine cool, had depleted the fuel reserve.  Additionally, two generators were lost  All things considered, the decision was made to attempt to reach Malta rather than return to Benghazi.  Sometime after setting course for Malta, they saw land ahead and while Navigator Clifford argued it was too early to have reached Malta, the fuel situation dictated a landing as soon as possible.  A long shining strip was sighted on the land which they could identify as a landing strip.  As we turned toward it, one engine quit.  Flight Engineer Gibby quickly transferred fuel and got it restarted.   I also restarted #3 engine and proceeded with a straight in approach and landing.  Prior to that time, the crew had donned their Mae Wests and parachutes and stood by to bail out if things got quiet.  A safe landing was made and rolling to a stop, we were met by a British Officer in a jeep who informed us that we had landed, not on Maltaa, but Comiso Airfield on Sicily, just a few miles from the front lines.  He advised us to remove our aircraft as soon as possible, it was a big target!\r\n\r\nWe loaded 500 gallons of fuel by hand from British 5 Imperial Gallon, Jerry cans most of the day and into the twilight.  After landing DeVinney, Clifford and myself were fortified by two pieces of stale toast and a cup of tea in the Officers Mess, we attempted to sleep in chairs.  The location of the other crew members remains a mystery.\r\n\r\nWe accomplished the return to Benine Main, I was nearly starving when I caught up with Major Moore.  His greeting was \"Where in the Hell have you been\"?\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon of that same day, I was instructed to attend mission briefing for a very important target.  In the briefing I learned I was to lead the Group in \"Suzy Q\" against transportation targets in Rome.  Half of Moore's crew had dysentery and \"Buzzin Bear\" was undergoing four engine changes by the ground crew and half of the flight crew.  Defenses were light and the mission uneventful except this was my 26th mission.  Ploesti\r\nwould be my 27th.\r\n\r\nAfter the Rome raid, we started practice bombing and flying in larger formations of aircraft at low, very low, altitude.  I had actually completed my combat tour of duty with the Rome raid, and I didn't believe that Howard (Moore)  or Colonel Leon Johnson really expected me to fly the upcoming mission.  I don't know why I did either.  However, it was \"high adventure\" and although I didn't know what the destination would be, I hated to miss out on it.  Furthermore, the crew of the \"Buzzin Bear\" didn't want to go with a new pilot.  As and additional incentive, I was thoroughly enjoying the low-level flying.  So I went.\r\n\r\nThe only other individual that I am aware of who had also completed his tour (there were probably others) and volunteered to go was Captain  Roland B. \"Sam\" Houston, one of our best people and an old friend.  Sam was killed with crew while following Jim Posey's formation over Target Blue Five.  He bombed successfully, but went down during assembly for the return.  Sam's gunner also shot down the German Fighter as they were crashing.\r\n\r\nI was flying the slot directly behind Colonel Johnson in \"Suzy Q\", and was the designated deputy leader should \"Suzy Q\" go down.  Notwithstanding that his target had already been mistakenly struck by another flight, Colonel Johnson took his formation through fire and smoke, attacking fighters and withering fire from an unexpected Flak Train to deliver their bombs on target, then turned to fight their way homeward until the enemy, out of fuel and ammunition, gave up the pursuit.  Two aircraft returned to Benina Main non-stop with four engines running, \"Suzy Q\" and \"Buzzin Bear\".\r\n\r\nTwo weeks after the Ploesti raid Howard Moore, having completd his combat tour, turned the command of the 67th Bomb Squad over to me.  I had just been promoted to Major.  I began making preparations for the return of the Group to England when we were ordered to mount a raid on the airfield at Foggia, Italy.  Some new crews had arrived and I scheduled seven aircraft.  There was Jim Hill and Charlie Henderson, the veterans; three new pilots and crews, my crew with two new pilots, Lt. Leighton C. Smith and Flt Officer Joseph S. Milliner (he had flown Ploesti with Henderson) in \"Buzzin Bear\" and a veteran crew from the 506th, Walter Bunker with Dick Butler, who had transferred to the 67th, as Co-Pilot.  Lt. Walter R. Bateman and crew, on their first combat mission were in \"Suzy Q\", and the new crew of Lt. Carl S Hager were in their new plane \"Black Sheep\".\r\n\r\nBecause of their experience, I scheduled the former 506th crew to lead the 67th.  Previous missions to targets in this area, as well as the one I had flown to Foggia, had been made without loss and not much opposition.  So on August 16, I proudly watched them take off-the first mission of the Squadron under their new Commander.  It was a heady feeling!\r\n\r\nThe first hint of trouble came when the veteran lead crew returned early with engine trouble.  Later, when it was all over, only Hill returned!  Our men had run into an estimated seventy-five to a hundred German fighters which had been recently moved down to Italy.  Our Squadron lost five of the seven planes and crews, including my own\"Bear\" and the \"Suzy Q\".  From that day on, I never sent a crew out on a mission that was not absolutely required, or a crew that I did not consider tried and ready for combat.\r\n\r\nI signed on for another tour, took the Squadron back to England, then the return to Africa and back to England.  I relinquished command of the 67th when promoted to Lt. Col. and replaced Bill Strong as Group Operations.  I remained in this capacity with the exception of a stint as Vice Group Commander until the end of the war.  In my post-combat service, I flew nine more combat missions as Command Pilot without mishap.",
