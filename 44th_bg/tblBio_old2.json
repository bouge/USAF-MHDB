    "bioArrivedHow": "First Tour: Via ship, \"Queen Mary\"  - -  Second Tour: Via Troup Ship Convoy",
    "bioTripDetails": "Personal Memories/Experiences: (1) This was when the 44th moved in September 1942 to the ETO.  At the senior age of Nineteen:  I remember my first viewing of the Queen Mary.  While standing on the loading warf someone commented that the QM was one big ******** target!  Yes - She was but she was super fast, too!  I remember fondly the high quality bedroom facilities (sixteen to a small cabin) and equally remarkable dining arrangements (for thousands at a setting, a setting taking hours on end.)  For the five days/nights across the Atlantic it was:  One night on deck to view the \"Heavens and Stars\", and the next evening relaxing in our \"cozy\" bedroom suit - ah the \"fresh scent of the sea\" (sea ?)!  Witnessing the beauty of the Firth of Clyde upon arrival in the United Kingdom was honestly awe inspiring, the Ladies of the British Red Cross were \"Angels\" with their tea and biscuits.  Oh Ladies if you could only realize even to this day (1998) how wonderful you were to we \"Boys\" in 1942!  Chettington, our first Air Base, while small it still was \"home\", and the British people were oh so most warm and loving.  Then to Shipdham.  What a mess it was until the \"mud\" was conquered.  But it was a new Air Station as new as we were overseas and trying to be brave and dedicated.  What a lovely sweet and supportive community.  God certainly blessed we Yanks with such a truly wonderful people to be our neighbors!  In a Post Script sense this support and caring was equaled throughout the United Kingdom!  Then came the opportunity to raise my level of rank and growth.  The Boards for West Point, and for Officers' Candidate School, Miami Beach were truly most exciting and rewarding.  Thanks to a small supportive group of Officers(a few graduates of West Point) I was coached and \"cheered-on.\"  I successfully secureed both appointments from the 8th Air Force.  Desiring to marry made the appointment to OCS my easy, happ and forever best choice.  Amazing as it is - sometimes young people do make good decision!  I departed for the ZOI and OCS in late January 1943, and graduation on June 26, 1943.  Latter on I attended Aerial Gunnery Officers Course (for possible assignment as a B-29 Fire Control Crew Duty.)  However, luck came to my rescue, no B-29s, and I filled a draft for overseas duty that took me back to the UK, and with Lt. Col. (then) Bill Brandon's help, while both of us were at the Stone Replacement Depot, I was reassigned to the 44th and duty as a S-2 Officer in the 67th.  Luck stayed with me and I was back in the 44th, renewing some solid friendships; later-on, with the CO's approval I completed a substitute/fill-in role as an Aerial Gunner on eight missions.  This made me most happy if not nearly satisfied.\r\n\r\nSpecific Mission Comments:  None in particular with the exception of the mission that the Pilot (???) (Squadron:  ???)  while on the bomb run - experiencing great airspeed/control difficulty in maintaining his position did, in an effort to complete the mission, dropped out of the 44th formation to \"tack on\" to a following group.  In the meatime another B-24, possibly experiencing similar difficulty, of a \"up front\" group immediately filled our slot (number four, low element) and THAT aircraft instantaneously caught a direct burst of flak, exlploded and was a total lost.  As I recall the target was the submarine pens at Harburg (??).  We made it back to England but were late in returning to Shipdham because of low fuel and had to be refueled at a friendly RAF Air Station.....Jerry Can by Jerry CAn.  This was the day I learned when we returned to Shipdham of my promotion to First Lieutenant.  Believe it or not --- I truly celebrated my promotion to First Lieutenant as no other - before or later on!  It told me that I had another \"Mission\" ... I am to this day thankful and prepared to do His Mission!",

We resumed combat operations on 18 March 1945 with a Squadron Lead on a raid on Berlin.  At the IP we began to get heavy flak and high, fairly heavy cirrus clouds in the target area.  We were prepared to bomb by Mickey (radar) when suddenly the cloud cover broke, our Bombardier found the aim point and we dropped visually.  We had good squadron integrity and made a briefed left turn off of the target.  We encountered more clouds on withdrawal.\r\n\r\nCold, cold, cold winter of 1944 & 1945 during the Battle of the Bulge.  How glad we were when on Christmas Eve the weather broke and all of 8th AF flew max effort missions to bomb every German supply artery to the Ardennes.\r\n\r\nThe Smith Crew flew the 16 Jan. '45 raid on Dresden - long distance and adverse head winds necessitated landing at Orly Airdrome, Paris, France.  There were so many recoveries of B-24s and B-17s into Orly, it took 3 days to service the Aircraft to get back to Shipdham.",

The experience of \"sweating out\" a Buddy and if he was going to make it back safe.  Listining to some of the stories those combat crew members has to tell about what it was like being shot at and terrible flying conditions.\r\n\r\nI will call this a Medical Special Missions ... that took place in late 1942 and early 1943.  The English Hospitals had all they could handle so we could only do so much with what was available.  The Medical Staff would always have ambulances and medical help on standby during take-off time and when the planes should be returning from a mission.  At times when more medical was required, a plane and crew was ready to fly out the wounded or ill to an American Hospital some where in England.

Aside from the combat memories of flak and fighter attacks and sweating out fuel and mechanical problems, I most remember the camaraderie; the evenings in the Officer's Club after supper with poker games and the crowd around the crap table shouting, \"two pounds with him\" as the shooter rolled the dice. And when I remember those evenings I always think of Sam (Rowland B.) Houston playing his record of Peggy Lee's \"Why Don't You jdo Right\", over and over again util we threatened to break it. Sam was one of the \"Good Guys\" of the 44th. He and his cjrew were lost over the target at Ploesti while flying an EXTRA mission AFTER they had finished their twenty-five!\r\n\r\nWhen I came out of the hospital in the summer of 1943, after a bout of pneumonia, there wasn't a Co-Pilot's spot open, and I was made a Squadron Gunnery Officer. One of my duties in that position was to fly as Gunner-Observer in the tail turret of the lead ship when the 68th led the group. On February 25, 1944 on a mission to Furth, Germany, I got credit for shooting down a ME-109 German fighter. I probably hit it, as I fired enough rounds at it, but so did a lot of other gunners. But the enlisted men on the crew got a big kick out of a PILOT flying in a turret and they all swore that I got it, making me one of the few Bomber Pilots or Co-Pilots in the ETO to be credited with a \"fighter kill\".\r\n\r\nOn March 18,1944 I was flying co-pilot for 1/Lt H. R. Nichols in B-24J No. 100112Q, nicknamed: \"The Paper Doll\", on a bombing mission against the Dornier Aircraft Works at Friedrichshaffen, Gemany. We were hit by flak over the target and forced to abandon the ship by parachure over nearby Switzerland. We were interned in camps at Adelboden and Davor. In September I escaped into France and got back to England. I reported back to the 44th and was sent home to the United States. After flying B-24s at a Gunnery School at Tyndall Field, Florida for a few months I went through OTU on C-54 Transports at Homestead, Fla. and was flying the Pacific Run in the Air Transport Command when the war ended.",

    "bioArrivedFrom": "Grenier AB, NH",
    "bioArrivedHow": "Via Gander and Prestwick by air along with 19 other B24s, #23819",
    "bioTripDetails": "Immediately after takeoff from Gander (Nav) Lt Leroy Perlowin obtained a celestial fix that we used to make our great circle time and distance turns across the 1600 mile of Atlantic Ocean. We were headed east of Prestwick when our radio operator picked up a mag heading that brought us directly to Prestwick. After holding in seven procedure turns for forty five minutes we finally was given permission to \"pancake\" (the ceiling was 500 ft and one half mile visibility when spotted the runway).\r\n\r\nWhen we took off from Gander we were all overloaded with spare parts, supplies,  and personal gear, and \"other cargo\". My best friends, Tom Cramer in AC #23800, and Jim DuBard in AC #23786 divided up a load of 78RPM records. I took a heavy portable phonograph in my AC #23819 only to learn at Shipdham that the English current operated at 50Cycles. We had to \"play\" the records with the aid of our finger to get the RPM up to useable speed. Later on during the war: Jim DuBard's aircraft was the first 44thBGP combat casualty (Dec 6, 1942). I went down (Rugged Buggy) at Kiel on May 14, 1943. Tom Cramer, who took over the 68th Sq when I was shot down, was killed on July 2, at Leece, Italy.\r\n\r\nAlthough the air and ground personnel were patriotically enthusiastic about getting close to the enemy to slow up Hitler's war machine we were all somewhat frustrated and disappointed by our first efforts in the air war over Europe. We soon realized that any \"trip\" across the English Channel was never a \"milk run\", that those Germans were good and dedicated in their profession. They were playing for keep!  As stated in \"Liberators Over Europe\" - \" ***  for everyone in the 44th the early years of 1942 and 1943 were lonely ones in the skies over Europe and dangerous ones.The American bomber effort in Britian was virtually at a standstill. The 44th flew three missions in December. The weather although bad was not entirely the cause. Bomber deliveries and replacements were not coming over, and North Africa was demanding more and more. The 44th was temporarily an orphan o fwar and a flying laboratory for the experimenters of daylight bombing.\"\r\nThere were a series of missions where weather, navigation, oxygen malfunctions and mid-air collisions contributed to needless losses of planes and crews. One recollection of a real snafu was the first American raid on Germany (Jan 27, 1943). The 44th climbed out of an overcast over Lemmer, Holland and got beat up by a hord of German 190s and 109s before anyone realized that we had made landfall too early. The B-17s at Wilhelmshaven had minor resistence so we really turned out to be a diversion (theirs). My flight in the right side of the formation took the brunt of the attack. Our AC23819 was hit by 20mm cannon and 30cal head-on attacks, killing Reggie Grant (Bmdr) and Mansford Deal (WGnr). Leroy Perlowin(Nav) was severly wounded, George Guilford (WGnr) received minor 30cal wounds. Almost simultaneously - a FW 190 broke off its attack and collided with my right wingman, Nolan Cargile, AC 23690, killing all crew members.Maxwell Sullivan, AC23776, was hit by 20mm and exploded. Albert Glass(Nav) was blown out of the AC, he was picked up a German patrol boat, then treated in German hospitals, later he was repatriated in July 1943. MEANWHILE - my AC had lost its #3 engine, all hydraulics, and smoke coming out of the left wing. After the Germans broke off the attack we were assisted by John Deihl (AC 41-23816) when he broke formation and dropped down to give us protection. Our Flight Engr Bob Billman calmly transferred the fuel from the left tanks to the right fuel tanks,and we survived the 250 miles back to Shipdham. The ground crew and fire rescue in chopping holes in the wing found that all of the rubber fuel cells had turned to crisp powder, fortunately a non-explosive state.\r\n\r\nThere were  many other close calls during my Twenty-One missions. On March 8, 1943 mission to Rouen, we had to give up the Group Lead and return to base with a sick crewman.We did later rejoin the group over the Channel. In this our deputy lead, Captain Price (AC41-23784) and his wingman Bob Blaine (AC23774) were immediatley shot down at the IP with only one survivor (POW). Our lives were spared by this incident of a sick crewmember (he had passed out).On the mission I was shot down this same crew member was captured and made a POW. My \"shot-down\" story is recorded in detail in Will Lundy's \"Roll of Honor\" (page 39-42). One BIG memory of my POWlife was when General George Patton entered our camp (April 30, 1945) at Moosberg (over 100,000 POWs) and personally shaking my hand after a short brusk interview. He is quoted as saying\" \"Hump, do American Officers live like this?\"",

Low level mission to drop supplies to paratroopers at 200 feet so supplies we dropped did not land in German hands. Also that there was no opposition from the Germans. \r\n\r\nNeedless to say, two of our squadron ships were shot down. No one survived on the other aircraft. Myself and Bob Vance were the only two that crawled out of our wreckage. Wounded, we hid out for about a hour but were finally captured. I spent seven months in hospitals after being released by the Germans when the 2d Armored Division overrun the town we were in.\r\n\r\nOn the mission we were shot down crew had become complacent due to briefing that there was no opposition and no one wanted their flak suit. All their suits were in the waist. Vance and I used ours and used the rest of them to line floor where we were standing. Probably one of the factors we survived the crash!!\r\n\r\nAircraft lost was \"Sothern Comfort III\". Seven crew members killed in the crash landing in Germany. Bob Vance and me (Lou De Blasio).",

We called for fighter escort, but could not get any. We then proceeded to head for our own lines. We had to throw out all unnecessary equipment in order to stay airborne. We were somewhere near Stuttgart Germany when there was an explosion. I was in the bomb bay throwing out equipment when I felt the explosion and realized the ship was in trouble and felt like it was going down. It happened so quick that I had time to only buckley one side of my chest chute to my harness and jump out of the plane. As I was floating down in my chute I saw three German ME109s following the ship down, and did not see it hit the ground. I saw only three other chutes. I landed in a small wooded area at the top of a hill. It did not tke the villagers long to get up the hill and find me. They had double barreled shot guns and pitchforks with them. I was captured alone, as the other three men landed across a large river near another village. I was put in a room in a house and did not see who the other men were until that night when I was put into a car with them. We were put into a small jail cell in a village somewhere for a few days with only bread and water to eat. After about a week or more they took us to a train station in Stuggart and sent us to the German town of Goppingen where there were four German Hospitals. Our tail gunner died in the hospital and was buried in a cementary not to far from the hospital. We were liberated on the 21st of April 1945 by the 44th Infantry Division of the 7th US Army.\r\n\r\nAfter being liberated I was sent to the 240th General Hospital in Nancy, France and from there to Camp LUCKY STRIKE for former POWs and then on a ship out of LaHarve France to the USA.",

An aircraft went down every time they came in. We lost five aircraft from our squadron on that mission. My buddy JOHN LYMAN went down that day. He survived the POW camp and came home. I got credit for shooting down one enemy that day. I received the DFC also the Air Medal with 3 Oal Leaf Clusters. I left for the USA before I received  my other two clusters to the Air Medal.

After the ceremony, I left the group theater and was walking down the blacktop road toward the Tech Site. Jimmy Callier was approaching from the opposite direction..Jimmy threw a salue and I returned it. Then behine me I heard: \" I'll be dammed!!  A bastard in the morning and a son of a bitch in the afternoon\"..The evening of the next day, Jimmy and I were in London. As we were crossing the street, two Majors were crossing the opposite directon.They were: Joe Young and David McCash. When they saw me in an Officers' Uniform they were certain that I was impersonating an officer. It took a lot of talking to convince them that I was legitimate.\r\n\r\nPolesti was NOT personally my worst mission. On May 14, 1943 at Kiel Germany I was plastered to the ceiling of the ship and could not move when we dove to avoid a head on collision with a FW190. This happended again at Wiener-Neustadt on Oct 1, 1943 when we lost all the surface covering of our left vertical stabilizer.

During the first wave of attacks,the \"CACTUS\" was hit in the #4 engine which caught fire and the ship lost altitude and left formation pursued by enemy aircraft. Shortly after this, #3 engine also caught fire with the ship losing aititude rapidly and headed for the island of Baltrum in the East Frisian Islands. Five parachutes were observed to open from this aircraft. As a large splash was seen following the ship, it is believed that bombs were salvoed before ditching in the North Sea approximately 10 miles N.W. of Baltrum Is. The ship was not seen to crash by any of the crews, but at the altitude at which it was last observed, it is doubfful if they made the island of Baltrum. All crew members were presumed killed, however the isolated grave of the Bombardier, Joseph L. Brenner, was located near Wilhelmshaven in 1947 by US Graves Registration personnel.",

(I recomended him for a Distinguish Flying Cross which he received later).  Since our trim cable was gone, I had everyone we could get, into the rear of the plane for landing.  I still have the cable splice which was given to be by the mechanics who repaired it.",

Transferred to Ordinance where I loaded B-24's with bombs for all missions. Section Chief Nick Barone and myself, were given the responsibility of loading a ship with time delay fuses. This procedure was both difficult and hazadous.  We were most fortunate that we never had an accident.  During that period, Capt. Ned Brizendine was our Ordinance Officer. \r\n\r\nAs a ground crew member, I always sweated out the missions and waiting for my combat buddies to return.\r\n\r\nI look back to when I was a young airman and how scared and unexperienced we were. We were from all parts of the US. We learned from each other and shared our best efforts.  We soon became formidable and as ground crewman, we gave our all to keep our ships flying. I am proud to have served with air and ground crewman of the 506th Bomb Squadron/ 44th BG - the \"Flying Eight Balls\". It will always be a part of my life.",

And those early mission wakeup calls...then that nervous appetite facing those powdered eggs and powdered milk, breakfasts. \r\n\r\nI remember the pre-mission briefings well. We could usually tell the hazardness of the mission by the strongness of the groans that we heard when the \"target\" curtain was pulled.\r\n\r\nAfter our 7th combat mission, I was awarded the Air Medal by Col. Gibson, along with the rest of the crew. Except for the pilots and bombardier, I did not get well acquainted with all crew members as fraternization between officers and enlisted men was discouraged, and we were together for a relative short period.

    "bioDetails": "21July 1944 Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany: An armament center west of Munich.  This mission was a long one, with bad weather from the English Channel to the target. Staying in formation was difficult. The bomb run was long and we were attacked by German fighters along with dense flack. One burst hit very close and the No. 1 engine was knocked out.  Faced with the knowledge that flying on 3 engines wasn't efficient and that it was an extra long haul back to England, our pilot asked me for a heading to neutral Switzerland.  I gave him a heading, but was concerned because I did not have a flight map of that country proper. After some time and using some main landmarks, such as Lake Constance and the Rhine River as guides, we desended below the clouds over Switzerland. After circling for 11/2 hours, we could not find an airfield adequate for a B-24. Since we were running low on fuel, the pilot gave the order to us to \"bail out\", which we did.  Most of us landed near Gonten, a small Swiss Village. Soon we were shocked to learn the Hoffman, the waist gunner, was killed when he landed with a partially opened chute. We learned later that he was buried in an Ameriican cemetery in Berne. After interrogations by Swiss authorities, the enlisted members of our crew were interned in Adelboden, in the mountains in central Switzerland, while the officers were interned in Davos, in the Alps of eastern Switzerland. After 3 weeks of quarantine, those of us interned in Davos were allowed freedom within a designated geographical area; subject to a strict evening curfew. On 25 Oct. I met a nice Swiss girl, Trudy Lang, who was near my age.  After that 1st meeting, we saw each other as oftern as possible. Realizing that we had many common interests, we fell in love. And so before I left Switzerland, with other internees, on 15 Feb 1945, I proposed marriage to Trudy and she accepted. It took us almost 2 years to procure her Visa to enter the U.S. She finally became my bride on 25 Jan. 1947 and she's been by my side since.",

We went to Stranrahr, Scotland: boarded a naval transport at 6 AM; ate breakfast of sausage and baked beans at 6:30 AM, stood on the rail with everyone else at 7:30 AM tossing our breakfast to the fish. The Irish Sea was running fifteen to twenty foot swells that morning).  We flew back to Shipdham, thank the Lord! Flew in B-24 H&J's manufactured by Ford at the Willow Run Assembly plant.  No complaints on this airplane.  It performed well and got us back safely every mission. B-Bar called the \"Iron Corset\" was our main aircraft.",

    "bioDetails": "The destruction of the Polesti Oil Refinery in June...a 1,000 airplane max-max type mission was in the command of our base commander: Colonel Gibson. About the time we were flying over the north coast of Germany near the Polish border, we were attacked at 11:00 high by a host of Me-210 a/c of the Luftwaffe.  Col. Gibson broke air silence and said \"Put those wingtips in the waist windows of your wingman and give 'em hell\". We did just that, as a group, and put red tracers in the path of those fighters..Lo and behold, the fighters veered off and hit the group behind us and their bomber losses were great that day. The top cover USA fighters were late, but one P-47 spotted our flares signifying we were under fighter attack and dove down into the melee and chased several of them over the wky.  We proceeded to the I.P. and on to the bomb run. The pink flak, signaling the fighters to get out of the area, came up as we approached the refinery and very soon the black 88 mm flack came up everywhere. We dropped our bombs and turned northwest towards the North Sea; we looked back and saw black smoke climbing upwards of 40,000 ft. We knew we scored direct hits!  I always wondered what the rest of those 964 airplanes did that day.",

    "bioArrivedHow": "By ship, the SS Chantilly. New York to Scotland.",
    "bioTripDetails": "One of most significant memories of my life was the trip over to England and the ETO, on board the SS Chantilly. The ground echelon of the 506th BS/44thBG, consisting of 14 officers and 270 enlisted men, boarded the SS Chantilly in New York on 2-28-43 for this 17 day crossing. This French ship had been previously condemned but taken over by the British in 1940. It was manned by a few British and the rest Hindu from Calcutta, India. There were approx. 1,000 troops on board for the crossing. The first 11 days were un-eventful, aside from very poor sleeping arrangements, seasickness, and probabley the worst food any of us had ever eaten. On 10 March at about 6:30PM we heard an explosion and the muster bell rang. We learned that our Captain saw the first torpedo coming toward us and he laid the Chantilly on her side and the torpedo went along our starboard hull and hit the ship ahead on us on our port side. We then changed course every few minutes by rocking the ship (as much as 43 degrees sometimes) from one side to the other and continued this for the rest of the night. Around midnight, we were attacked again. It was too dark to really see how much damage was being done, but we knew it was bad.  Around 3AM we heard another explosion and either a munitions ship or tanker with high octane gas was hit and the flames grew larger and larger, lighting the entire area.  The light endangered the whole convoy, so a British Corvett shelled the ship and a terrific explosion followed with the flames shooting hundreds of feet in the air. The ship then quickly sunk.  In our position at the rear of the convoy, there were three ships behind us and three ships to our front. At dawn on 11 March, we found that we were alone and well behind the rest of the ships.  All six ships were either sunk or some may have changed position. We felt that we were like sitting ducks inthis vulnerable position. We spent the next day trying to catch up with the rest of the convoy. Obviously, we were probably the slowest ship on the seas.  Luckily, no more attacks were forthcoming. Later we were to find out that 5 ships in this convoy of 74, had been sunk and several damaged during the U-boat attacks on 11 and 12 March 1943. The HMS Harvester was damaged when she rammed a U-boat. She took on board prisoners from the U-boat, and afterward sank, herself. It was reported by German prisoners that there were 12 U-boats in the vicinity of the convoy. Two subs were reported sunk.  Our ship was very fortunate. The Chantilly sailed up the Firth of Clyde near Glasgow, on March 15, 1943. After a long train ride from Scotland, we finally arrived at Shipdham Aerodrome on 17 March 1943.",

    "bioTripDetails": "On 3 August 1944, our crew, with Pilot Gene Gossett, was assigned to lead our group to Mery-Sur-Oisr which is Northwest of Paris, France. We were to bomb an underground storage which housed the \"Buzz\" bombs which the germans launched over to England. The weather was not conducive to flying a bombing mission this day. Our flight plan took us on a counter-clockwise route around greater Paris. Shortly after crossing over the English channel, all groups were given a recall back to their respective bases. For some reason, we did not hear that recall. Consequently, we continued on course.  We saw group after group flying counter to us, some coming very close. Our pilot and Mission Commander -Capt. Donald Heaton (West Point), noticed the return of the other Groups.  A quick decision was made to continue on to the target.\r\n\r\nAfter reaching our IP (Northeast of Paris), I was looking at broken clouds almost verticle cigar shaped.  I could see the target area at a bow in the Mery-Sur-Oise river. I was lead bombardier. One squadron strayed to the left and dropped their bombs about a mile South of the target.  The squadron to the right, did not drop at all.  Why they were not dropping on my cue, I will never know.  In any event, our squadron hit right on the target.  We arrived back to base at about 1400 hours with a nember of personnel anxiously awaiting our safe return.  We waited in the dining hall for the strike pictures to be developed and delivered.  There was a cheerful, victorious roar.  We had indeed hit the target!\r\n\r\nOn another ocassion, on one of my earlier missions, we flew with one man short.  Our nose gunner could not fly that day. Our pilot asked me if I would fly the nose turret which I did. After take off and making our rendezvous, I climed into the nose turret and proceeded to try to charge the guns.  I noticed the cable which charged the guns was not on its pulley.  I reached in between inner and outer shell of the turret to try to place the cable on to the pully.  The cable kept slipping off because the pully had a broken segment in it.  I worked on the problem for about 3 hours without success.  We were in enemy territory by now and I had resigned myself to having zero guns which would fire.\r\n\r\nI looked away from the cable and broken pully and suddenly saw about 15-18 Me109's at 12 O'clock high.  I called the crew to alert them. Not having any guns, I was helpless.  At the last moment, the enemy veered off to chase another group.  They were so close I could see the silhouette of the pilots. The good Lord had his hand on all of us.",

The flak had ruptured my K-Ration and an orange that were sitting in my cubby hole.  I was glad to be alive, but mad that I had nothing to eat the whole way back to England. \r\n\r\nI cannot write of my experiences without mentioning my admiration and gratitude to my pilot, GEORGE M. BEIBER. Although he was only four years older than I, he had a maturity that kept us all alive. He seemed to have an instinct for knowing where the flak shell was going to explode, and knowing how to avoid it.  Looking back I think we were a charmed crew. Of the four crews that trained together at Biggs Field, Texas, ours alone emerged from our thirty five missions unscathed.

    "bioTripDetails": "My first mission was to the German submarine pens at Kiel, Germany on May 14, 1943. By this date, there were 2 B-24 Bomb Groups in England. The combined groups were able to get up 19 planes in the air for this mission. 7 of the 19  planses were lost.  I felt then, that about \"three missions was my limit and my odds would be up\". In July 1943, our group was transferred to North Africa from Shipham. We found out we would be flying a low level mission to Ploesti, Romania. In the briefing  we were told that we were going in low because the enemy had so many AA guns there. Their guns would not come down to a horizontal position, so our planes could fly below the German 88's that were in place. We were told that there would be many fighter aircraft to engage us and that the expected losses for us were 50%. We were also told that if we lost 100% of our planes, that it would be worth it to the war effort. We left Bengasi early the morning of 1 Aug. with delayed action fuse bombs. Acid fuse bombs were dangerous because they had a glass with acid in it, and if the glass got broken or cracked, the acid leaked and caused the bomb to explode. As we approached our target, there was a \r\nB-24 on the ground with the crew lined up beside it waving to us. On the bomb run there was lots of smoke and machine gun fire. We pulled up to 150 feet to get over the towers of the refinery.  As we were going over the top, the #3 engine quit. the co-pilot reached to hit the feathering button, but hit the #4 instead at about the same time.  It was a lucky mistake because when the co-pilot saw what he had done, he un-feathered it. It raced before it caught, or before the governor caught it, causing lots of vibration, then the #3 engine started. It was found later that a barrage balloon cable had cut into the wing, grounding the #3 magneto wire. The vibration had shaken it loose!!  It looked like one of every three planes was on fire as we left the target. One plane, on fire from wing-tip to wing-tip, pulled straight up.  We passed under it.  Two people bailed out and it nosed back into the ground.  Shortly after that , a fighter plane attacked from the rear.  He didn't want to pull up because too many guns would be able to shoot at him.  He passed by our right wing close enough I could see his face, but could not get a shot because he was between us and our other planes. When he was a little ahead of us, he hit the ground in a ball of flames.  We pulled up to get over the fire.  This trip lasted over 14 hours. Of the 25 missions that I flew, the most famous and dangerous one, was this raid to Ploesti called \"Tidal Wave\". I was lucky to have survived it. There were 179 B-24's from 5 Bomb Groups that carried 1600 men, flying from five air bases around Bengasi, Libya that day, to bomb Ploesti.  54 aircraft and 310 men did not make it back. We wrecked the refinery, but the Germans built it back in a matter of months, and it had to be bombed again, but from a higher level.",

I left the 68th BS in Oct. 42 to join the 506thBS, which was coming to Shipdham in Feb. of 1943. My Commanding Officer told me that a new Squadron of B-24's would be arriving from the States \"with no mechanics\" and my chances were good that I could make Master Sgt., as the other Crew Chiefs were.  When the 506th arrive, I learned they came with their own Crew Chiefs and ALL of them were Master Sgts. Just my luck!  It took me two months to get back to the 68thBS.",

On a raid to Schwabish-Hall Airfield, Germany, (a Jet Aircraft airfield), our 29th mission, our aircraft \"Three Kisses for Luck\" I BAR -193 was hit by very heavy flak before we reached our target. We lost our #2 engine and had our fuel cells punctured and hydraulics hit. It was touch and go if we would bail out. We lightened the ship having lost over 10,000 feet of altitude and then two P-38's joined us and escorted us to an airfield used by our artillery spotters very close to the front lines. The aircraft was later salvaged and was still flying at the end of the war and was flown back to the states.",

I was looking out the starboard side and saw a B-24 close to us get a direct hit and explode in a large ball of fire. Nothing was left of the A/C or crew. \r\n\r\nOn another mission to Berlin, the flak was very close and intense.  Our aircraft shook with every close burst and a piece of flak went through our ship just inches from me. I saw some fellow floating down in his parachute amidst all of that chaos and I've often wondered if the poor chap made it to the ground still alive. \r\n\r\nMy last mission was probably the most memorable. We were on a low level mission of 24 March 1945 while supplying our paratroops and glider troops that had landed across the Rhine river near Wesel, Germany. Flying at about 200 feet, we took a bad hit from ground fire causing the aircraft to shudder. We were on fire in the bomb bay and a starboard engine was aflame. Lt. Max E. Chandler our pilot, apparently lost control of the aircraft as we hit the ground with the aft part of the ship. We then continued to be airborne for approx. 90 seconds and then crashed. Moments later the ship exploded. Sgt. Louis DeBlasio and I were partially thrown clear and though we were wounded, we managed to crawl away from the burning wreckage just before it exploded.  The rest of our crew were not so fortunate as they were killed in the crash and/or the explosion. Shortly after, Lou and I were captured along with a P-47 pilot who had to bail out close to the ground. A German artillery unit turned us over to a German Medical unit and we ended up in German hospitals.",

Among these were Berlin, Brunswick, Munster, Bernberg, Lechfeld, Solingen, Calais, The rocket sites in France and Norway. In my time in the service, I have been shot down, have parachuted and have survived a crash landing. I was narrowly missed by flak and fighters and I scored one victory by shooting down an enemy fighter. I feel all of this was nothing compared to two of my fellow crew members, Lt. David Edmonds, killed on return from a mission in March 1944 and T/Sgt. Abe Sofferman, shot by the Germans after parachuting into Nazi occupied Belgium.\r\n\r\nIn my time of service, I figured while I was over enemy territory, I was missed by 1,000 flak guns, 400 fighters and dropped 20,000 pounds of bombs or more, on enemy targets.  I am proud of the way my fellow aircrew acted and by the thousands of others in the 8th AF. I also admire the bravery of the enemy pilots of the fighters who opposed us.  Both sides in the airwar exhibited great courage and carried out their duties.  Sorrrow should be extended to the hundreds and thousands of enemy pilots who died in battle as well as those on our side.  There are no winners in war.",

    "bioDetails": "At briefing that a.m. (April 27,1944), we had been told that there was one battery of four guns at the target. We were on the bomb run, Paul Chagnon - Radio C)pr., was on the catwalk holding the bomb bay doors open, I was in the top turret; immediately after dropping our bombs, we took a direct hit just outboard of No. 3 engine and lost the vong from there out. I saw it start spinning like a seed pod falling from a tree in the fall season. I was thrown forward in the turret as the aircraft started spinning to the right, and I started coming out of the turret during which I saw Chagnon bailing out from the catwalk with my chest chute. Someone pulled the plane out briefly and then we started spinning again to the left. I managed to get Chagnon's chute from his position, got it on, and went to the catwalk to bail out. When I bailed out, Lt. Oarey was on the catwalk to bail out when I left the ship. \r\nI finally found the ripcord and started my descent, slipping the chute on the way down and ending up with a badly sprained right ankle. (I took up bowling after the war to strengthen it up.) After getting to the ground, Chagnon came to help me and French civilians were trying to help us; they carried our chutes off and, of course, were speaking French. Chagnon had been born in Canada and had been brought up on French until they moved to the U.S. when he was 6 or 7 years old; but that day, he didn't remember one word of French, so the civilian efforts were of no avail. \r\nAnyway, Chagnon was helping me; then the French abandoned us as the Gen-nan military began to arrive at the scene. Chagnon and I approached a barn, which we hoped to get into and hide. As we rounded one corner of the barn, the Gen-nans came around the barn corner at the opposite end with their little \"burp\" guns and that was it. \r\nThey put us into a small truck the bed position had a cover on it; and inside the truck was Lt. Clarey's body, his chute had failed to open. The Germans took us to a building with an underground bunker where we stayed one or two nights, then through Paris to Dulag Luft, and from there to Stalag Luft VI via the 40-or-8 rail cars. We were subsequently evacuated from Luft VI to Luft IV via that damned freighter down the Baltic. From IV, I was shipped to Luft 1, again on a 40-or-8 rail car, and Chagnon wound up on one of those forced marches as the Germans fled from the approaching Russians. \r\nThe Gen-nans abandoned us at Luft I just a few hours before the Russians arrived. We were eventually evacuated to Camp Lucky Strike in France. I left there with another guy and wound up in Paris for a few days, air hiked to London, spent a few days there before turning back to the military and subsequent repatriation to the states. My time in Paris and London were financed with loans from the Red Cross, which I paid off here in Houston after the war.",

The group was in final training and we left only a couple of weeks later for overseas.  First an unforgetable train ride from Oklahoma City to Ft. Dix, NJ!  Then aboard the biggest ship I had ever seen!",
    "bioTripDetails": "Going Overseas:  Going aboard I was handed a ticket that said Cabin A85-Double Occupancy.  I thought this was going to be great - 2 guys to a room!  How wrong I was!  When I reached the room I saw about a dozen bunks and found out that \"double occupancy\" meant 24 hrs in room and 24 hrs on deck!  Even in August it was cold on deck at night.  I finally found a little nook out of the wind to sleep in.  I got the bunk in the room right by the portholes.  It was interesting to watch the ocean and how far the ship rolled while zigzagging to avoid any subs.  Also, when on water I real hungry and 2 meals a day were not enough.  I came across a pal from radio school who wasn't eating so I borrowed his mess pass a few times for some extra meals!  When we arrived at Greenock, Scotland, I was not happy to see how everything and everybody seemed so tired and worn and dirty.  It was easy to see that they had been having a hard time.\r\n\r\n\r\nMemories while Overseas: The rewards of trips to the Holy Land while in Africa seeing the pyramids and Sphinx.  Trip to Paris for Easter '45.  The flight over Germany and the Rhine after surrender and the incredible destruction.  Trips to London and Scotland.

    "bioArrivedHow": "Flew B-24 plane across to the CBI and did the same to ETO in England.  Left on 26 June 44 from Langley for trip to England.  Left from W.P.B. on 21 AUG 42 for first tour in the CBI; from WPB to Natal then across to Ascension Island and then Africa, Arabia, and then India (03 SEP 42).",
    "bioTripDetails": "Just proud to have been in the Air Corps, to have been able to serve on combat and live throught it.  Served with good officers and enlisted men, many which I still hear from.  Combat in ETO was rougher but raids with the 10th in the CBI were longer.  Just glad to have made it through both combat tours with nothing worse than malaria.\r\n\r\nService in the UK with the 8th was somewhat rougher than the CBI.  Those German 88's were rough and the German Pilots were much better than the Japs.\r\n\r\nMy first tour of duty was with the 10th AF.  It was by chance that I became a combat crewman on a B-24.  The plane stopped at Morrison Field in West Palm Beach for routine maintenance.  The lad, they had as a tail gunner, disappeared while there and as soon as I heard about it, I asked for the job.  I had been to A & M School at Casey Jones School of Aeronautics in Neward, NJ and had just returned to duty at West Palm Beach and was working in the flight hanger.  I asked the Pilot, a trainee of the B-24 factory in  California, he agreed if Headquarters of the 49th Pursuit Group to which I was attached approved.  The assignment was approved, when the ship left Morrison for duty with the 10th AF based in India, I was one of the crew.\r\n\r\nWhat I learned at Casey Jones was helpful since all my previous mechanical training had been on large Disel and Steam Engines on a hugh dredge on which I had been working for several years in South Florida, deepening harbors, straightening rivers, etc.  This was really not much help on aircraft engines but the flight engineer started to re-educate me on B-24's and I have always been grateful.  He had been a rancher in Idaho, and was really a BIG man.  I fit into places where he couldn't.  His re-education of me on the B-24 was a good training as the months I spent at Casey's.  We had a good tour served under Chenault, Vinegar Joe Stillwell, etc. and really did get to see a lot of that theater since our ship was one of the first B-24s if not the first to get to India.  We flew across the the South Atlantic at the same time Wendell Wilkie was making a tour of air bases prior to running for President.  We landed at Calcutta, and then to several different bases.  Finally to \"Chen Tu\" where we hauled gas a few trips over The Hump for gas to the A.V.G. at Chen Tu.  We made missions off and on, one to bomb a big coal mine the \"Linsi\" mine in the extreme NE corner of NE China.  The flight was 14 hrs. and 30 minutes and as cold as I have ever been.  They were shipping coal to the Japanese.  We made it home in the dark, thanks to an A.V.G. radio man playing records on a small victrola for us to home it on.\r\n\r\nWe stayed for several weeks at Chen Tu then were sent back to India, moved around from Allahabad to several jungle bases and finished our first combat tour and were sent back to the states to be reassigned to our next tour with the 8th AAF, 44th Bomb Group.\r\n\r\nI have never been sorry I made the move from West Palm Beach.  We changed all four engines on the ship we flew in the 10th AF.  I have a big box picture framed with a lot of my service memorabilia and at the top is the Pratt & Whitney emblem from one of the engines we changed on our ship while in India.  I value it because it took me so many interesting miles during that tour.\r\n\r\nI served with the 44th BG until wars end.  I was flight engineer for William D. Kelly's crew.  Our plane's name was \"Purtitanical Bitch,\" which we had to change to \"Puritanical Witch\" after we arrived at Shipdham.\r\n\r\nI spent most of my leave time in London mostly visting the Tower of London and Westminister, what a place of places.\r\n\r\nA B-24 was on tour in Ocala, it had a young girl pilot, who did a good job.  I took my son along on a ride.  He was amazed at how small and crowded it was.  I guess he is used to traveling in these new monsters.",

I reported this on the intercom, but no emergency crank was available up front to get me out and I couldn't get back in the plane.  Then enemy ME-410's struck, clobbering the squadron below us!  I had said my prayers and figured I was a gonner if the plane sustained any serious damage when someone brought up the emergency crank from the tail gunner's station and freed me.  This was after the \"action\" was over and a rescue could be affected.  I never found out why the turret malfunctioned.   What an initiation.\r\n\r\nI continued to serve on Lt.

    "bioTripDetails": "My first 18 missions were flown with Robert E. Felber as pilot.  The remainder were flown mostly with Capt. Charles Hughes althoug as alead navigator, I flew with numerous pilots.  It was arough tour of duty.  On the raid on Ploesti, of the 17 planes in the flight we were in, only 5 returned.  On the October 1, Weiner Neustadt raid, the 44th Bomb Group was nearly wiped out.  In the 66th Squadron, we brought home the only plane in the low level raid on the oil fields at Ploesti.\r\n\r\nI flew 25 missions:\r\n\r\nAugust 01, 1943        -  Low level raid on the oil fields at Ploesti\r\nAugust 13, 1943        -  Messerschmit factory at Weiner Neustadt, Austria\r\nAugust 16, 1943        -  Fighter base of Goering's Flying Circus, just norht of Foggia, Italy\r\nAugust 19, 1943        -  Railroad yards at Foggia, Italy\r\nSeptember 09, 1943   -  Air Field at Abbeyville, France\r\nSeptember 15, 1943   -  Target at Conches, France\r\nSeptember 24, 1943   -  Railroad yards at Pisa, Italy\r\nOctober 01, 1943       -  Airplane engine factory at Weiner Neustadt\r\nOctober 18, 1943       -  Back in England.  We flew a decoy mission over the North Sea.\r\n                                   One our groups was attacked by JU-88's and we all got credit\r\n                                   for a mission\r\nNovember 03, 1943    -  Bombed Wilhemshaven, Germany\r\nNovember 05, 1943    -  Bombed Munster, Germany.  This was the first time we had fighter\r\n                                   protection and it greatly reduced our losses\r\nNovember 26, 1943    -  Bombed Bremen, Germany.  This was a rough mission for us.  Our\r\n                                   plane took a terrific beating from flak and fighters buty we got\r\n                                   safely back to base.\r\nDecember 01, 1943    -  Bombed Solingen in the heart of the Ruhr Valley.  We had great \r\n                                   fighter protection but the flak was very heavy\r\nDecember 05, 1943    -  Bombed an air field at Cognac, France\r\nDecember 13, 1943    -  Kiel - we led the entire 2nd Division on Kiel.  Major Kahl flew with\r\n                                   us as COMMAND PILOT.\r\nDecember 20, 1943    -  Bombed Bremen with excellent results.  Martin was to lead but he \r\n                                   aborted early and we took over the lead and bombed the target\r\n                                   with good results.\r\nDecember 22, 1943    -  Bombed a V-2 rocket installation with good results.\r\nJanuary 05, 1944       -  Led raid on Keil with Col Culbertson as Command Pilot.  We were\r\n                                  out of position at the target so he ordered us to turn and bomb the\r\n                                  target directly into the wind.  We dropped bombs directly on target\r\n                                  but at that slow speed; we all aged ten years.\r\nJanuary 30, 1944       -  Bombed Hanover with excellent fighter protection, especially by\r\n                                  the Thunderbolts.\r\nFebruary 03, 1944      -  Led the 2nd Air Division on a mission to Germany.  The weather\r\n                                   was so bad that we flew all over Germany trying to find something\r\n                                   to bomb.  We finally returned home.\r\nFebruary 06, 1944      -  Bombed a rocket installation at St. Pol\r\nFebruary 16, 1944      -  Bombed St. Pol again\r\nMarch 02, 1944         -  Bombed Frankfurt, Germany\r\nMarch 08, 1944         -  Led the entire 8th AF on the 2nd raid on Berlin.  The first raid on\r\n                                  March 6 was led by Fortresses - a total of 68 planes were lost.  I\r\n                                  led the second raid and was very successful getting the 2400\r\n                                  bombers and fighters over the target.

We got back to England and had to crank everything down (flaps, wheels, etc.).  \r\n\r\nNever got attacked by enemy aircraft until last mission on 4/7/45.  I was flying with a different crew.  The tail gunner got credit for downing an ME-109.\r\n\r\nWhile on base at Shipdham, when not flying missions, several of us organized a 15 piece swing band.  I played trombone and did some vocals.

    "bioArrivedHow": "Picked up new B-24 at Grenier AFB, Manchester, NH, 6/44; flew it to Goose Bay, Labrador; picked up survival gear (no armor); tents, stores, food, tools, etc.  Flew from Goose Bay to NUTTS Corner, Ireland.  Was told to leave brand-new plane with them.  Entire crew was again sent to school to learn latest battle tactics.  Assigned to 44th BG, 68th BS soon after, Shipdham, England.  Flew first mission 07/19/44; completed tour last part of Nov., '44, -54degrees altitude over Hamburg, Germany.",
    "bioTripDetails": "In Aug. '44,  flying low left of entire formation, we crossed the Rhine River into Germany, caught intensed and accurate flak; #2 fuel tank was hit and losing gas very fast.  Turned back toward France and asked for fighter support, which resulted in a beautiful P-51 Mustang coming up and tucking himself under our right wing.  He had swastikas under his canopy; his name was \"Bean City Charlie.\"   He vectored us in to a P-47 base outside Paris, city name Coulomoniers.  We landed and parked the plane off to one side. \r\n\r\nOne week prior, this had been a German airfield, now a P-47 base.  We then transferred fuel from the damaged tank to the others; then went into town and bought some food, some wine, and French perfume, using the 4000 French francs from our escape kit.  Next day we flew our plane back to Shipdham.  We had been MIA for a day.  \r\n\r\nAbout two weeks later, we were told to report to the Finance Office.  It seemed we had spent about $10.00 worth of francs and the Finance Department wanted their money back!  No matter that we had brought back a $250,000 plane, and had slept under the plane's wings.  We were docked $10.00 each.  Is that how wars are won?\r\n\r\nIn October 1944, over Hamm, Germany, I was in the waist of the plane throwing out chaff, which to me always seemed to attract the German's radar.  Flak was heavy.  to my surrise and shock, a piece of flak came through the other side of the fuselage, cutting the tail-gunners oxygen line and hitting me in the right buttocks.  Wow, what a blow, like being hit with a baseball bat -- one big bruise.  The crew cut my electrically-heated flight suit; my pants and underwear were cut open and I was put into an electric blanket to prevent shock.  I stayed that way until we landed about 3 hours later.  I downplayed the incident at interrogation and did not encourage my pilot to put me in for the Purple Heart.\r\n\r\nI have been told that the Purple Heart now ranks just below the DFC.  Just one more thought:  I found that the result of my being in the Air Force and in a combat situation gave me a great deal of conficence in myself; also, being an AF instructor and talking to B-29 crews about those missions resulted in my becoming a salsman, giving me and my family a better living standard.  All my children are professional college graduates, one a lawyer.  I was lucky to have survived since we lost 2 out of every 3 flyers!\r\n\r\nI am putting down these thoughts in the hope that the 65% of the combat flyers who died, some right before my eyes, will be remembered.  It could have been me; even though I was a married man with a 6-month ould daughter, I felt my country needed me and what I could do would be some good.  To future generations -- I hope you are never in combat; it never leaves you.  However, if you are, it will not be forgotten.",

I was sent to Camp Campbell, Kentucky, to the 20th Armored Division in an armored Infantry Division.  There I took army Basic Training and was made Pfc. in charge of the drum and bugle corps for our regiment.  I took and passed the written exam for Air Corps Flying Cadets.  The Air Corps sent me to a Nashville Air Corps base for an Air Corps flying physical.  I passed and within a month I was sent to Jefferson Barracks, Missouri, for an abreviated Air Corps basic training.  Apparently the training schools were overloaded so we were all sent to College Training Detachments (CTD) at Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio.  After about 4 months there I was sent to San Antonio Classification Center and requested Navigation.  I was sent to Navigation School in San Marcos, Texas, and graduated  as a 2nd Lt. about 25 SEP 44.  Then I was sent to Westover Field, MA, for crew formation and crew training.  Our crew (Robert Sanders;) was sent to England as a replacement and I flew our crew's first 9 missions.  Then I was assigned to Alconbury Base for training as a radar navigator.  I was in Alconbury on VE Day.  Shortly thereafter the radar navigators were hurriedly sent back to USA for reassignment to the Pacific theater.  VJ Day occcurred while I was at Boca Raton AAF and by about October or November I was given terminal leave though I remained in the Reserves.",

Suffered a broken neck; cheated death by about 30 seconds as I was rescued by crew members as the plane exploded in flames.  Paralyzed for 5 weeks; spent 8 months in hospital at Biggs Field, El Paso, Texas.\r\n\r\n1943 - Wanted to go to war ASAP.  A co-pilot vacancy opened and I grabbed it.  Went overseas with Lt. C. Hagers crew in July, 1943.\r\n\r\nAug '43 - 1st mission (Foggia, Italy) Lt. Pimental (Henderson's crew) exchanged places with me just prior to take-off.  He was killed on that mission.  (I stayed on Henderson's crew until we were shot down on 01 OCT at Weiner Neustadt.)\r\n\r\nOn Weiner Neustadt mission we were low squadron.  The group made a hard left turn into us.  We couldn't maintain air speed and had to slide under the group to the other side - no protection for our 6 air craft.  About 8 or 9 ME-109s jumped us.  I think 4 or 5 B-24s were lost quickly.  Henderson gave his life to save ME - that I know.  A Waist gunner/Navigator Wmilliam Newbold and myself were saved.\r\n\r\nI made a special trip to Dallas, TX, to inform his family of his heroism.  Our B-24 started to go into a flat spin (2 engines out) and he held the wheel completely over and when I motioned to take the wheel he refused to relinquish it.  When I tried to jump into the open bomb bay I fractured my skull and was unconscious when I fell out.  Recovered on the ground.",

We were unescorted and used zigzag, evasive action across the Atlantic to arrive at Glasgow, Scotland on 21 June 1944.  From Scotland we went to Kilkeel, Northern Ireland for bomber crew orientation.  Then in early July arrived at the 44th Bomb Group, 66th Bomb Squadron at Air Station 115 near Shipdam, England.",
    "bioTripDetails": "On Raid #1, my left waist gun wouldn't fire.  Suddenly all the discipline of basic training and the training at Gunnery School paid off.  I was able to surmount my panic and get that gun to fire.\r\n\r\nOn Raid #2, just as we passed into enemy territory, I turned around and found the right waist gunner unconscious, slumped over his gun because of an improperly fitting oxygen mask.  I spent the rest of the raid reviving him over and over because he could not seem to get his oxygen mask fixed.\r\n\r\nOn Raid #3, we had terrific flak over our target Kiel, Germany.  In spite of the fierce flak, we only had one flak hole in our plane.\r\n\r\nOn Raid #4, a stray B-24 attached itself to our plane.  There were rumors the Nazis had restored some crashed B-24's and were using them to join our bomb groups, shoot up our planes, then make a quick retreat.  We kept a close eye on the stray.\r\n\r\nAfter Raid #6 we were pulled from flying raids and began flying a black B-24 all over the United Kingdom.  When we tried to find out why we were doing this we were told the information was classified.  We never did find out what we were doing.\r\n\r\nOn Raid #8, we were in moderate but very accurate flak.  Suddenly, I got what felt like a swift kick in my left buttock. I thought the right waist gunner was clowning around.  I checked on him but he was minding his own business.  Then I saw a piece of flak under my feet.  It had come in through the chaff  chute and hit me.  It did no harm but the white-hot metal scorched my glove when I picked it up.\r\n\r\nOn Raid #10, we flew into a cold weather front and suddenly planes ahead of us and our planes  were engulfed by a dense cloud of condensation.  When we and our two wingmen came out of the condensation we were lost from our group.  So, we joined another group.  That group felt about us like we felt about the stray plane that latched onto us on Raid #4, they wanted to shoot us down.  Right after we bombed their target one of their planes began slipping down on us.  It was within inches of us when the copilot saw what was happening and put us in a dive.  That is all that saved us.\r\n\r\nRaid #11 was a hedge-hopping flight into Holland to drop supplies to paratroopers who had gone in behind German lines.  Our bomb load was ammunition and K-rations.  The Dutch stood on dikes waving white sheets as we went over while the Germans fired small-arms weapons at us.\r\n\r\nOn Raid #12 we had to abort on takeoff  because of engine failure.  We got off the runway and were quickly taken to a brand new B-24.  With practically no preflight, we were off again.  Everything on the plane was stiff.  When I test fired my gun it fell apart.  I kept my cool and got it fixed.  We had all kinds of troubles with plane on the entire flight.\r\n\r\nOn Raid #15 we were nearing the Dutch Coast when I decided it was time to put on my parachute harness.  When I reached for it in my flight bag it was not there!  I learned later someone had inspected our lockers, took my parachute harness out of my flight bag, tossed it on the floor of my locker, and put the bag back on top of it.  When I picked up the flight bag I assumed it was just as I had left it from the last raid.  Fortunately, we did not get any flak or see any enemy fighters on this raid!\r\n\r\nRaid #21 on Metz, France was flown in direct support of Gen. George Patton.  The Germans had slowed him down, but just before we bombed the primary target we got an urgent message NOT TO BOMB THAT TARGET BECAUSE PATTON HAD TAKEN IT!  His troops fired a line of \"friendly\" flak to direct us to the secondary target about five miles ahead.\r\n\r\nBy Raid #27 we had been a lead crew of an increasing number of raids.  On this raid we had the honor of leading the entire Eighth Air Force.\r\n\r\nBad weather hit England and Europe in December.  The Germans found a weak point in the front lines and launched a blitz that became The Battle of the Bulge.  All our planes were grounded and things went bad in The Bulge.  On December 24, 1944, the weather finally broke.\r\n\r\nOur Raid #28 was the largest air raid in history.  Everything that could fly, flew.  Our target was the neck of The Bulge to help cut off access into it for the Germans.  It was a clear day, and we could see fighting on the ground, and the anti-aircraft gunners on the ground could clearly see us, too.  They nearly got us, but we escaped their fire and our bombardier hit that target dead center!\r\n\r\nShortly, after we flew our first raid the  ball turrets were taken out of the B-24's and we suddenly had an extra gunner on our crew.  It was decided three of us would rotate and miss every third raid the crew flew.  After Gunner Robert (Bob) Rusch and I missed one raid each it was decided to train Gunner John Dubrock as a radar operator.  When the rest of the crew finished their raids Bob and I still had one to go.  After waiting around a month and a half on March 15, 1945, I flew my last raid to Berlin with a crew on their 13th raid,a crew that had already bailed out of another B-24, a crew that did not trust their engineer and a crew that did not get along with each other.\r\n\r\nOn returning to the states, I went to Gunnery Instructors School at Laredo, Tx.  From there I went to the AAB, Las Vegas NV as an instructor until the war ended.  By that time I had  accumulated enough \"points\" to be discharged early.  I was sent to Sheppard Field, Wichita Falls, TX and discharged 26 Sept. 1945.  I went home to Oklahoma and arranged to attend college on the GI Bill to prepare for the ministry.  I was ordained to the ministry in 1952, continued in the ministry until I retired in 1990.  I continue to be an ordained minister.\r\n\r\nI have written a book, \"The Wild Blue Yonder\" which gives a complete story of our bombing raids.  Copies of the book are on file with the 44th Bomb Group Veteran's Association Historian;  the Editor of the 44th BGVA journal, \"Eight Ball Trails\", The Eighth Air Force Museum, Savannah, GA; and the American Room of the Norwich, England Library.",

My assignment was to put food on the \"dumbwaiter\" and send it up to the mess deck when they needed it.  After all those months in England without milk or ice cream, I suddenly had access to all the food, desserts, milk and ice cream I wanted.  Working the galley kept me so occupied and relaxed, I had a great time, and was never seasick.  We docked early in the morning on 28 April 1945.  I went on deck and for the first time saw the Statue of Liberty in the harbor.",

Then we lost the supercharger on #3 and prop control on #2.\r\n\r\nThe pilot, Kent Miller, gave the order to bail out, knowing we could not get back to Shipdham.  When the Bombardier opened the bomb bay doors, through a break in the clouds, he saw we were over water.  The pilot countermanded the order and said to prepare for ditching.  When we ditched the nose broke off alongside the co-pilot's seat, and when I released my seat buckle, I floated clear of the plane.  I will never know why I was the only survivor.

    "bioTripDetails": "On 1 Oct. '43 on the raid over Wiener Neustadt the ship was hit head on by fighters and the crew bailed-out.  I was captured and in solitary confinement at Hohemark, Germany.  After 19 days of interrogation, I was taken to a hospital in Obermasfeld, Germany for 20 days to treat a wounded leg.  This injury seemed small compared to a Spitfire Pilot from South Rhodesia in the bunk next to mine.  He had lost a leg and an eye but invited me to his home after the war to Pan for Gold!  I was next taken to Stalag Luft III in Sagan on 10 Nov. '43 and was there for 15 months.\r\n\r\nAt 3:00 A.M. on 27 Jan. '45, we were forced to march to \"Stalag VIIA\" in Mooseburg.  We walked via Muskow (34 miles), Spremberg (16 miles) then into 40 x 8 cattle cars for 3 more days. It was the coldest winter in 25 years causing hunger and freezing down the line.  Jim Selasky and I sucked on hoarded dried prunes from Red Cross packs to keep going, when the prunes were gone we ate the pits.  We kicked and prodded one another to keep going since \"Stragglers will be shot\"!!\r\n\r\nWe were in the dysentery infected Hell Hole of Mooseburg for about 3 months.  On 29 April'45 we were liberated by Patton's 3rd Army 14th Armored Division.  Instead of waiting to be taken out for medical examination, John Swanson (shot down on Kiel raid) and I escaped to ride the \"Red Ball Express\" (Patton's supply line) arriving in Paris on 8 May'45--V.E. DAY!!!\r\n\r\nAs the trucks were loaded with liberated French Cognac, the memories from here on are rather hazy!!!\r\n\r\nThe mission that gets you is, of course, the worst as was \"Wiener Neustadt\" 1 Oct.'43.  However, Ploesti 1 Aug.'43 rates a close second.  We encountered intense flak and fighters, and observed four B-24's destroyed (Houston, off our rightwing) with both right engines stopped at about 150 ft. over the target, Brazi Blue with right wing dipping while snapping a balloon cable.\r\n\r\nSeven hours later, we landed at Benina with the #3 engine out and #4 damaged, no hydraulics, tail control cables flayed and holes through the gas tanks.  Most of the credit for our return goes to two exceptional pilots, Walt Bunker and Dick Butler, whose extreme efforts, skill and focus made it possible for us to fly another day.  Between these two dates Bill Cameron assigned Bunker's experienced crew to lead the 67th on the 16 Aug'43 Foggia mission.  As fate would have it, for the first time ever, engine trouble made us turn back.  Only one ship from the squadron returned that day, James Hill's \"Calaban\".",

    "bioTripDetails": "Our first Mission was 9/30/44 and was truly a baptism of fire.  Our target was Hamm Marshalling Yards.  One plane in our formation was hit by flak, caught fire and blew up.  The pilot of that plane was lst Lt. Arthur S. Ledford ASM 0-705401.  The tail gunner, S/Sgt Henry P. Stark was killed.  The rest of the crew became POW's.  It was their eighth mission.  The enlisted men on our crew shared the quonset hut with the enlisted men on Ledford's crew.\r\n\r\nI flew a total of 33 missions, 25 with Lt. Daily and 8 as nose gunner and bomb toggler with 2nd Lt. Alan C. Graham's crew including one to Berlin on 3/18/45.\r\n\r\nWe were a good crew, we all liked and respected each other, and we all did our jobs well.  None of the crew was ever wounded.  We were out of touch for 43 years but found all six of the living crew members (three were deceased) through the 44th Bomb Group Group Veteran's Association.\r\n\r\nAfter returning from combat duty, I was sent to the State of Washington to fight forest fires along with a lot of other combat fliers.  We lived at a former CCC Camp.  We were on call 24 hours per day.  When we were called we sometimes rode in army trucks 200 miles to the fire.  This was my duty for about 4 months until discharged in Oct. 1945 from the 326 Engr. F.F. Co. in Spokane, Washington.\r\n\r\nMy sincere thanks to the ground crews who worked tirelessly to keep the planes flying.  The air crews received all the glory, but the ground crews are every bit as deserving of glory as the air crews.  We could not have done our job without them.  You were MAGNIFICENT!!!",

Tofte, pilot.\r\n\r\nMy Third Mission was to Koblenz, Germany with our original crew and pilot as was the fourth mission to Oberpfaffenhoffen (Munich Area) Germany.\r\n\r\nThe fourth mission on July 21, 1944 was the last and final mission for me and the other eight members of the Donald F. Tofte Crew.  On the way to the Munich area, we ran into heavy clouds which caused the formation to break up.  We were able to reform before we reached the target area but we were not in our assigned formation position.  Flak was extremely heavy at our altitude and German fighters were also spotted.  After the bombs were dropped, before we could close the bomb bay doors, flak hit the fuselage and wing and the right inboard engine (#3) and into the bomb bay damaging the hydraulic system and rupturing a gas tank.  The bomb bay doors remained open and every other door and window was open.  Since we were having trouble with an engine and the loss of gasoline, we knew we could not make it back to England.  Our pilot headed for Switzerland. Finally, after some difficulty, Swiss fighters appeared and guided us to the grass airfield at Dubendorf. We crash landed with the nose wheel collapsing and we skidded nose down into a farmer's corn field adjacent to the airfield.  The aircraft we lost on this mission was called Channel Hopper #42-95226C MACR #7286.  This aircraft was scrapped per a report I obtained through the Swiss Government.  (A picture of our aircraft in the farmer's field at Dubendorf Airfield in Switzerland is enclosed -note serial numbers on tail)",

In Feb. 1944, I became commander of the 44th Bomb Group replacing Col. Frederick Dent.\r\n\r\nShar-Hei was the only aircraft I crewed.  This plane was lost by the Group in June 1943 on the Emden, Germany mission.\r\n\r\nAll missions without \"friendly fighter\" support were extremely difficult, hazardous and SCARY! Of the original 38 B-17's which we were assigned, 30 were lost in combat.  As additional crews came in, none were assigned airplanes, just used as needed to complete crews.\r\n\r\nI was assigned to lead Division to Brunswick, Germany, an aircraft manufacturing plant on Easter Sunday, April 8, 1944.  I was command pilot, leading 44 Liberators.  German planes came toward them at the IP, head-on at 12:00 high.  We lost the Deputy Lead Commander as a German fighter hit his plane, but the gunner on Lehnhausen's plane hit the fighter, which crashed into the plane behind.  A total of 350 planes were dispatched on that mission, 44 were lost.  The 44th Bomb Group sent 44 planes, 11 were lost.  It was the greatest loss the 44th had in all WWII Operations.\r\n\r\nEnjoyed the 44th Bomb Group's 200th mission party.  Along with General Leon Johnson,  I was tossed into a pond outside the Barracks.  No one flew that day.  Officers did not wear bars to identify rank, except one Captain, who was first in the pond.\r\n\r\nI flew as Leader on D-Day, June 5, 1944.  General Leon Johnson was the 14th Combat Wing Commander.  We hit the shore line at low altitude at 5:30 A.M. bombing the big guns over Omaha Beach.\r\n\r\nMy last mission with the 44th was in July.  I led the 14th Combat Wing of the 2nd Air Division to an Oil Refinery in Politz, on the German/Poland border.  It was low altitude flying at 18,000 feet against a barrage of flak.

We also talked about the courage, determination and hospitality of the English people, the assistance and cooperation of the RAF and the mutual respect that existed between the USAF and the RAF, specifically, the RAF admired our courage to conduct our operations in daylight but thought we were\"...A Bit Balmy...\" to do it.  At the same time, we admired the RAF's courage to operate at night but we thought they were \"Nuts\" to do it.  We practised flying our missions at night but after a couple of \"Dry Runs\", and many \"Near Misses\",  we gave up the idea as \"Too Risky to Life and Limb\".\r\n\r\nOn November 23, 1943, on the occasion of the presentation of \"The Congressional Medal of Honor\" to Col Leon W. Johnson by General Jacob Devers at Shipdham,  I was priviledged to be one of the speakers interviewed for the BBC coverage of the event to talk about Col Johnson and his exploits.\r\n\r\nI was Lead Navigator on the mission to Kiel, Germany, May 14, 1943.

We led a formation of nine aircraft.  We lost #1 and #3 to flak over the target but decided to \"nurse\" #2 and #4 and head for home.  All unnecessary gear was unloaded enroute including our chutes after the entire crew decided to stick with the aircraft rather than bail out over the Mediterranean and/or the coast of Africa,if we reached it.  Fortunately, we reached home base and began our descent.  Then suddenly #2 sputtered and was feathered and while on final #4 quit (fuel starvation we learned).  Because Bob Kolliner was a product of the Capt Robert J. Abernathy school of coming in on final high and with a steep glide angle, he was able to maintain the speed and glide within safe limits and miraculously put the aircraft down safely on the desert floor about 200-250 yards short of the runway.  As we literally hit the ground Bob Kolliner instinctively hit the throttles as he usually did upon landing thinking we still had power.  (I observed this personally as I always left the nose on landings and stood behind the engineer.)  The aircraft rolled the 200 yards through mine fields and craters and stopped just short of the runway.  A grateful crew cheered Kolliner and Moore.",

    "bioArrivedHow": "Pilot John Diehl landed AC 816 named \"Blackjack\" at a British Bomber Base at Belfast, Ireland. The control tower advised us park off the taxi-way.  This was a heavily loaded B-24.  Turning on the grass (which was boggy soil) AC 816 sunk halfway up the wheels.  The aircraft had to be unloaded and with the help of a crane they got 816 out OK, we then flew to Preswick and on to Shipdham, England",
    "bioTripDetails": "On the Bordeaux mission 17 May 1943 - while I was on my bomb run, someone yelled out that T/Sgt Harry C. Hogan, Left Waist Gunner, had his parachute accidentally open and was pulled out of the aircraft.  Pilot John Diehl informed the crew that we were on the bomb run and that interphone silence would be adhered to.  Also, he said that after the run we will discuss Sgt. Hogan.\r\n\r\nOn Mission 29 May 1943 Aircraft 816 was a lead aircraft to bomb the locks at La Pallice, France.  My bombs were direct hits on the locks.  After this mission 2nd Air Division referred to me as the \"Lock Buster\".\r\n\r\nOn 14 May 1943 our mission was Kiel, Germany.  In the middle of the night I got a call from 44th Operations, relating to me that Operations at 8th AF wanted me to call them.\r\nThey did not have any bombing tables on 100 lb. incendiary cluster bombs (25 ea 4 lb individual bombs) they said they had heard I was an expert on \"Bombing Theory\",  I accepted the challenge thinking it would be easily found --wrong.  They were right there were no such bombing tables.  I checked with the Army Demolition Engineer, Army Armament and noone could help.  So I worked out a bombing problem for Ops at 8th AF and gave them the bombing tables I had managed to work out.  The B-24 bombing results were outstanding.\r\n\r\nOn the Ploesti mission of 1 Aug 1943, I flew as bombardier with Pilot Reggie Phillips on Aircraft 619.  We were very fortunate to get back from this hectic mission in one piece.  A few weeks later my parents were notified that I was Killed in Action on Ploesti.  I notified my parents that I was alive.  I had Intelligence contact higher Headquarters that I was alive. Newspaper reporters reported that I was OK.  My mother was awarded my Purple Heart, Posthumously.  The mission was 1 Aug 1943 and it took until 1947 to get my records correct.\r\n\r\nMY FATHER HERBERT M. LIGHT, SR. AND I HERBERT M. LIGHT, JR. SERVED IN WORLD WAR II AT THE SAME RANK OF MAJOR.

    "bioArrivedHow": "My Crew left Topeka, KS had a short stop at Camp Kilmer, NJ and boarded the Queen Mary for one of its dashes across the Atlantic.  The Queen was so fast it traveled alone, without escort, and simply outran any German Submarines.The six enlisted men of our crew were assigned to a cabin normally for two.  It had been stripped of its peacetime luxuries and six bunks had been installed.  We were bulkhead to bulkhead with bunks.  We didn't complain though, the entire ship was gunnel to gunnel with troops.  Late November is no place to be on deck in the middle of the Atlantic, but there were troops that had been assigned deck space with only the protection of a canvas curtain put up at the rail.  Those guys not only had to contend with the weather, guys coming up from below for a breath of fresh air, but probably worst of all, those that got seasick.  There was one luxury that hadn't been removed from our cabin.  We had our own bathroom with bathtub, toilet and washbowl.  There was no fresh water available, but all the salt water, hot or cold, that we wanted.  The English ship's crew had a little private enterprise going.  They were selling big bully-beef sandwiches and a canteen cup of hot tea for a quarter.  Years later, when asked how I crossed the Atlantic, I could say I floated across in a bathtub.  Being an old beach bum, the salt water didn't scare me one bit.  So while the rest of the guys were piling on the clothes and freezing, I took mine off an climbed into a nice, hot, full bathtub.  I would get out to get a sandwich and tea, and then back I would go.  I was in the bathtub one day when someone came into the cabin and asked, \"Where is Powell\"?  The reply, \"Where do you think, he's in the bathtub.\"This made me laugh, so I floated across the sea in a bathtub.",
    "bioTripDetails": "I was a member of the Lucas crew.  I flew a total of 13 missions starting with Lucas on Feb. 21. 1944, but later was with several crews. My last of 13 missions was with Beiber's crew on Sept. 26,1944.\r\n\r\nTo start at the beginning as to the Lucas crew.  It should be known that my first love was for the Navy.  After graduating from High School, I would spend considerable time trying to enlist, so much so that they finally gave me a little medal for patriotism.  My problem was a bad looking left wrist.  It had been broken, and poorly set, when I was about 12 years old.  The result was a wrist with a bad knot and an arm that was 2 inches shorter than the right.  The Naval recruiting officer, knowing my desire to go to sea, got me a berth on a Richfield oil tanker that traveled between the West Coast and Hawaii.  I would be in Pearl Harbor shortly after it was bombed.  Sometime during the summer of 1942 the Maritime came under the jurisdiction of the Navy Reserve, which meant that I would be required to attend Maritime training, which meant I would be required to take the Naval physical again. I had tried to get into the Navy, the Coast Guard, the Marines and now even the Merchant Marine did't want me.  I wanted nothing to do with the Army.\r\n\r\nIn my hometown of Torrance, I ran into a school friend wearing the uniform of the Army Air Corps with the stripes of a Sergeant.  I asked how he managed to accomplish such a high rank to quickly and was told if I could pass the mental, and physical examinations, I would be sent to a school and upon completion of the school I would come out a Sergeant.  \"That's for me\", I thought, and mentally said, \"Good by ocean, hello wild blue yonder.\"\r\n\r\nI would pass the examinations.  The wrist was scrutinized, I would wriggle it, squeze the man's hand, but nothing was asked or said about the shortness.  It wasn't noticed.  On Nov. 10, 1942, I was inducted and sent to Fort Douglas, Utah.  From there I was sent to Shepard Field, Texas where I would receive shots and physicals.  I was also given choices of what elements of the Army Air Corps I'd like to be in. I requested Aircraft Maintenance.  In very short order I found myself, along with 6 other men at the north end of the base ready to attend the Aircraft Maintenance School.  I would never attend, what is commonly referred to as \"Basic Training\".  After completing the the maintenance course I volunteered for specialized training on the Martin B-26.  I did not come out a sergeant, I came out a Corporal.\r\n\r\nThe B-26 school was located at Green River, Maryland near Baltimore.  Upon compleltion of the B-26 school, I volunteered for Gunnery School.  This involved another physical examination by a flight surgeon to qualify for flight status.  Again, nothing was said, or noticed about my wrist.  After Gunnery School, I was sent back to Salt Lake and put into a pool for assignment to B-24's, not B-26's.  Oh well, they did have the same engine and top turret.  And I did get my Sergeant's stripes.  From Salt Lake I was shipped to Davis-Monthan, near Tucson, Arizona.\r\n\r\nShortly after arriving at Davis-Monthan I was assigned to the flight crew of one Lt. Robert Lucas, as an Assistant Engineer.  I remember a group of us standing on the flight line watching a B-24 land and taxi past us.  I remember distinctly thinking, \"I know they got it down, but how in the hell do they get that big son-of-a-bitch off the ground.\"  It was the biggest aircraft I'd ever seen.\r\n\r\nWe left Davis-Monthan for Blythe, California.  If we thought Arizona was hot, at Blythe we would be in training for Hell itself.  Where we would pick up the designation, \"Pettus Provisional Group\", I don't know, but that's what we were a part of at Blythe.\r\n\r\nAt Blythe more crew members decided they didn't want to fly.  One evening, after dark, we were preparing for a cross country training flight.  The aircraft had been preflighted, the rest of the crew, what we had, was on board, being the last to board, I was just about to enter the bomb bay when my attention was directed to a noise on my left.  What I saw was a B-24 turned over on its back coming at us.  I hollered as loud as I could \"clear the ship\". and took off running.  The aircraft crashed less than 50 yards from the concrete disperal area killing all on board.  If it had crashed on the concrete it would have taken a lot more of us with it.  It seems the plane had a runaway prop on take off, and another as it turned to return. Not too long after the crash, word came down the line to get the other aircraft in the air.  Lucas asked each of us if we would fly with him, and when we took off there were three people on board, Lucas, Capella and myself.  What reason others gave, I don't know, but I do remember that one stuck a pencil through an ear drum.  ouch!\r\n\r\nThe Pettus Group would be divided into thirds for the trip to England.   One group went via South America, one group via Greenland and Iceland.  Lucas would draw the Queen Mary.  From Blythe to the Queen we would make stops at Topeks, Kas and Camp Kilmer, NJ.  At each stop we would pick up additional crew members.   By the time we reached the 506th Bomb Squadron we had never flown as a crew.\r\n\r\nWe were assigned to the 506th on Feb 4, 1944.  I flew either 6 or 7 missions with Lucas.  On the last mission, I had difficulty clearing my ears.  No trouble going up, coming down from 25,000 plus was torture until they both ruptured.  I was grounded, sent to a rest home at Bournmouth, sometime later the Lucas crew had to land in Switzerland and were interned.\r\n\r\nOne incident, I remember while flying with Lucas on a mission to Germany.  Shortly after take-off Lt. Kircher found himself in the need of a bowel movement.  He used the raised door between the waist and the bomb bay as a toilet seat.  Upon reaching a higher altitude the waste froze solid.  As the bomb run started, and the bomb bay doors were ordered open, the doors on the #400 didn't open all the way.  The bombs would not drop when Hammer operated the release in the nose, so I was told to release them manually.  Taking a walk-around the oxygen bottle, I start in the rear bomb bays.  I believe we were loaded with 500# GP bombs.  Each bomb had a safety wire and pin attached to the nose of each bomb.  Working my way forward along the catwalk, I would arm a bomb and then release it manually.  When the last bomb was released I decided to watch to see if I could see it hit.  At our altitude it wasn't long before I lost sight of the bomb, but I kept bending lower and lower to see if I could see the explosion as the ground drifted past below.  Then, 20,000 feet below, an intersection of two roads came into view.  There were a few buildings surrounding the intersection, so my eyes became rivited on that area, I was somewhat startled to see an explosive cloud appear right in the middle of the intersection.  That last bomb had landed in the middle of the intersection as if I had used a bomb sight.    \r\n\r\nWhile I was grounded I got tired of doing nothing, so I approached Lt. Harbison, who was in charge of the Group Instructors, for a job.  I went to work in the turret building and \"Chubby\" Oblack and I operated the trap range.  When my ears healed I asked to be put back on flying status.  I was required to take a test flight to assure the flight surgeon that all was OK.  That flight was scarier than any mission I'd flown.  When we took off there was a Captain flying, another officer and two female nurses.  I was confined to the rear.  Where we landed I have no idea, but was told to standby for their return.  When they did I knew they had been drinking, but the worst was yet to come.  Why, I don't know, but the pilot was instructed to use the short, cross-field runway.  That runway had little distance between the end of the runway and a bunch of trees. The Captain dropped, and I mean dropped, that plane considerably short of the runway and we bounced like you couldn't believe.  If that plane didn't receive some structural damage it was a miracle, but we walked away from it, so all was well.",

    "bioTripDetails": "The 15th Bombardment Squadron (A-20 Boston Bombers) was the first combat organization to arrive in England.  We were first assigned to Grafton Underwood at Kettering and then moved to Poddingon. \r\n\r\nWe flew out first combat mission on July 4, 1942 against an airfield in Holland, six USAF planes and six RAF.  Our Squadron Commander, Major Keggleman was awarded the first DFC in the European theater on that mission, when his right wing hit the ground and he regained control of the aircraft and flew it back to home base.\r\n\r\nIn September the Squadron was sent to North Africa to participate in that campaign.  Along with 15 other gunners we were reassigned to the 44th Bomb Group at Shipdham.  The 44th had just arrived at Shipdham.\r\n\r\nUpon arriving at Shipdham, I was immediately promoted to Buck Sergeant.  It was a rule that no one less in rank than Buck Sergeant would fly combat.  I flew my first mission to Abbeyville on December 12, 1942, although I was assigned to a crew in the 15th BS (A-20's),  we didn't fly any combat missions.\r\n\r\nMy fifth mission on January 27th or February 28th (my records seem rather contraversial) turned out to be my most exciting (if that is the word) not only did we get badly damaged , we had to crash land on return to base.  I was officially credited with a 1/4 FW 90 kill and received my first decoration an Air Medal for five missions not the destruction of 1/4 of the FW, I don't know which l/4th it was the nose, tail, midsection or whatever.  \r\n \r\nThe rest of the tour went rather the usual except on my final mission to Naples on 17 July, the flack was as heavy as any I'd seen throughout my entire tour.\r\n\r\n*As far as I know only three of the gunners from the 15 assigned from the 15th Bombardment Squadron completed a full tour.  Several were POW's and a couple dropped out of combat flying for various reasons.\r\n\r\n*I was no braver than the rest but my background in the military may have kept me in as long as I was.  I was born and raised in the military, my dad retired with 30 years service in 1939.\r\n\r\nIn High School in Denver I was a Lt. Col., in Jr. ROTC and was the \"outstanding\" Red Trainee (second year) of the summer CMTC (Citizen Military Training Corp).  This was suspended after World War II.   It was a four year program to provide Reserve Officers.",

    "bioArrivedHow": "We flew the southern routes from Florida to Waller Fld. in Trinadad and on to the Amazon's mouth in Belem, Brazil.  We continued to Natal, Brazil, further down the coast, to hop the Atlantic near Dakar, Africa.  The ocean flight had a series of excitements, such as, wind, and hail in mid-ocean plus coming to land 100 miles north of our landing field.  Baker's radio skill got us last-minute contact with coastal crafts who led us into the runway.  As we touched down one engine quit followed by #2 before we quit rolling, and #3 quit before we parked.  Fingers were pointed at our Navigator and others for our missed landing pattern, but I recall the interest of the local flier in the cause of problems.  It was not until the 1990's meeting in South Dakota that Baker and I had an explanation of affairs.  The Germans had been leading incoming planes astray out over the desert to run out of gas and crash.  We very nearly were added to their list.  But our case also gave US men needed information which wiped-out the Germans.  Our next African hop was to the north side near Marrakech.  The war came closer home to us as we cleaned off our machine guns of cosmoline and other protective oils, and then mounted them as defense.  Our last leg was near enough German forces that had aircraft flew off Spanish and French fields with the habit of catching green crews unprepared and unalert.  We camped in tents and I made myself butt of a joke for my crew who had chased small lizards all over the area.  I had just cozied up in my cot when a gust of wind whipped the tent side against my bed.  I was thinking the boys had put a lizard in my F-sack;  I bailed out through the mosquito netting at record speed.  My rush awed the men who next cheered.  On May 22, 1944, we delivered the B-24H to Valley, Wales and were crushed to learn that the plane was not ours for combat.  Later we saw how much more mechanical work was required.  We had learned much on the flight, starting with my first power sprayers to air out the plane before landing and take-offs each day.    We also had new \"Gaucho Boots\" from South America which were very handy for extensive English walking.",
    "bioTripDetails": "On May 3, 1944 we left Valley for Stone, Eng. and did only Guard Duty or K.P. until May 11th when we were sent to North Ireland  ( on a very tired boat).  There we had a review of our respective crew roles until May 27th when we returned to England.  Early on May 29th we went to Shiphdam and reported to the 44th Bombardment Group, 67th Squadron.  We felt lucky as it was the oldest B-24 outfit in the 8th Air Force, fresh from Africa time.  Our first mission with them was the 44ths 3rd run on D-Day (June 6, 1944).\r\n\r\nWe flew 31 raids by 15 Aug. 1944; a short time and we were worn considerably by it; but had the skills of self care and for others.\r\n\r\nWe had a few \"Milk Runs\" to ease pressures from harsher flights.\r\n\r\nOur lst 4 raids were light French targets but #5 was Luneberg, GR complete with heavy and accurate flak-with us on left wing, low element!.  Next day it was Politz, GR perhaps the toughest of all our targets, plus a number of Jerry fighters.  To increase our pain, a bomb-release failure ended by a bomb hooked into the planes control cables.  Radioman Allen Baker saved us by going without flak vest or parachute-not even an oxygen mask, leaned astraddle the open bomb bay and lifted the 100 lb. bomb off and threw it outdoors.\r\n\r\nThe crew put Baker in for a Silver Star at briefing but we found out at a 1987 first crew reunion that he had not had the medal.  Without telling him, one of my pupils in Congress got with Baker's and they had action.  I took the reward to his home and his family gathered at church and we surprised him.  At the next crew reunion General John Gibson made the proper Air Force presentation.  ( Gen. Gibson was 44th BG Commander).",

I chose air combat not once but even after failing eye test at Mitchell Field in October1944.  Went with crew and received glasses by mail.\r\n\r\nNovember 10, 1944 the target was Hanau, Germany.  On the return trip I was shot in right hip over Koblantz by ground fire or flak.  Flak hit my wallet and a coin I had saved from Havana, Cuba.  The coin was deflected (was cut almost in half) and came through and out my back.  My crews expert care stopped the bleeding and saved my life.  They are the heroes, Lt. John Hobbs & Lt. Coopers Crew.  They were lost December 2, 1944.\r\n\r\nOn December 20, 1944 having been hospitalized since Nov. 10 was told my crew was lost and seven were killed in action.  At 19, I was unable to cope with this for we were like family. I will never forget the Doctors and Nurses at Wyndham Hospital for their medical and especially their devoted personal help in healing my mental condition.  I am most grateful to a nurse Lt.

While pulling up to 150 ft. after crossing the river for Primary Drop Zone, we lost our Waist Gunner and had to go to Seconday Drop Zone, then go around Wesel to clear the area.  While going over power lines, we were hit with small arms fire.  We had 14 holes across the tail.  This fire also hit the Chandler and Crandall Aircrafts on our left wing.  Both crashed, one aircraft hit,bounced and nosed-in. The other aircraft pulled up into a wing-over and nosed in.  We were the only Squadron from the 44th to return with damaged aircraft and losses.",

    "bioTripDetails": "He arrived in England with the 492nd Bomb Group.  While serving as Operations Officer, he often flew as Command Pilot on several missions in the 90 to 100 days that the 492nd was in operational status.\r\n\r\nThe 492nd was removed from operations in early August, 1944 and Col. Turnbull accompanied Col. Snavely to the 44 Bomb Group in the same capacity as they did with the 492nd BG.\r\n\r\nIn an April 28 V-mail from England, described in Allen Blue's \"Fortunes of War\", He wrote the Country over here is really beautiful but ! my is it cold.  We are busy as sixteen beehives as you can read in the papers, but we have a swell bunsh of boys and the best base in England (our opinion of course).\r\n\r\nIn a letter dated June 20, 1944, (to Elizabeth McWethy) he stated the Air Corps has been laughed at because of the medals but these kids really earn them, flying day after day into the heart of Germany.  I know fighter planes are the most dangerous to us but I believe flak is worse on the nerves.  Our courses are planned carefully and we know when we will be know when we will be hit by flak, but then we never know how accurate it will be.  Sometimes every plane in the formation is damaged and all return.  At other times none are hit but all at once one or two planes just explodes in the air from a direct hit.  We are protected from the fighters by our fighters and our own guns and we feel we can do something about our attack by them but when they hit us our losses are always much higher.\r\n\r\nLt Colonel John I Turnbull remembered by a teacher--\r\n\r\nJack graduated from Johns Hopkins University in 1930 as an engineer specializing in air conditioning.  There was not a great deal for engineers at that time.\r\n\r\nIn 1932 he went to Los Angeles and played hockey as a member of the US Olympic team.  He was most proud of his position as Captain of the US Olympic LaCrosse team in 1936 when the games were held in Germany.  Hitler reviewed the team, close enough to breathe on.  He regretted that he could not take the opportunity to whack him one and save the world so much grief.\r\n\r\nJack's success with these sports was not a small thing as they were games dear to the hearts of Marylanders at that time.  He shared his ability as coach at the Gilman School, a high school for boys bound for Johns Hopkins and Princeton Universities.\r\n\r\nHe was very interested in the kids at the school, also curious about my work as a kindergarten teacher, especially as my class of children had been displaced by the bombing of Pearl Harbor.  The little boys were generally disturbed, very difficult and unhappy.  It was possible to talk to him about the class.\r\n\r\nHe seemed to have more sides than a seal as one of his involvements was as a Lay Minister in the Episcopal Church.  He was mentioned as a well-known flyer around Baltimore at the time of his death.  Mr. Allan Blue speaks of the members of the Baltimore Flying Club going to an Anti-Sub Squadron.  Jack Turnbull was flying with a squadron at Langley Field in 1943-44.  No doubt he was a member of the Baltimore Flying Club.\r\n\r\nHe served with the 29th Division of the Maryland National Guard and transferred from there to the Army Air Corps.\r\n\r\nHe was much admired by the Maryland sports fans, he was generous with his time for relatives and friends.  He lived with special attention to Life, Hockey, La Crosse, his parents, ill or well, kids in school, kids in church, friendships and V-mail.  Whatever he was doing he focused on it.  He invested the most trivial activities with significance, turning the everyday into the divine.  Do it well was his life style.  He was a private sort of man but he was a man without margins, so much a part of life that you found yourself close to him without realizing it.  Really made of the right stuff.",

    "bioTripDetails": "The following experiences and memories of Robert Burton have been compiled by his son Charles who feels his father would be proud to be included in the database.\r\n\r\nAlthough I never sat down and interviewed my dad about his wartime memories, he did mention some of them on occasion, and he left two scrapbooks and assorted loose photos.\r\n\r\nMy father enlisted right after Pearl Harbor.  He originally hoped to become a pilot or gunner, but poor eyesight (colorblind) insured his becoming ground staff.\r\n\r\nI remember my Dad talking about taking \"sponge baths\" from water heated in his steel helmet due to cold and primitive conditions.  I also remember him commenting on the group being discouraged early in the war due to heavy losses.  He also told me that war was not very glamorous when one had to clean up the remains of friends after plane crashes.\r\n\r\nI remember my Dad telling about a dogfight going on over his base.  Suddenly, a plane broke out of the clouds and dove towards the base.  One of the ground crew opened fire on the plane with a machine gun.  It turned out to be a British plane and the gunner was threatened with court-martial.  Apparently, all kinds of stray aircraft were always landing at Shipdham, B17s, light bombers, fighters, and assorted British planes.  He also witnessed many crashes, both takeoffs and landings.  He saw Lt. Griffith's crash after the raid on Kjeller, Norway in November 43.  He has pictures of the crash site and remembered it in his scrapbook as \"the most beautifuf landing\" he'd ever seen.\r\n\r\nDuring the Ploesti raid, while the squadron was in North Africa, my father along with a number of other aircraft mechanics was transferred to service B24's on anti-submarine patrol in Newquay, Cornwall.  He has pictures of the ship that he serviced, Q for Queenie.\r\n\r\nSometime in the spring of 44, my father transferred from the 68th to the 506th squadron.  With the 506th, he serviced 2 planes, \"Ram It Dammit\" formerly \"Aries\" piloted by Lt. Bernie Scudday, shot down 6/27/44 and \"Tinker Belle\", the last combat casualty of the 44th piloted by Lt. Brown, shot down 4/5/45.\r\n\r\nI think that with \"Ram It Dammit\", he participated in a few missions.  This was his favorite plane.  I remember him mentioning that he threw foil or \"chaff\" out of the wasit gunner's window to foil German radar on a few missions.  I also remember him talking about Lt. Scudday asking him to accompany \"Ram It Dammit\" on what turned out to be its final mission, but he declined.\r\n\r\nHe also volunteered to salvage a crashed B24 close to the front lines near Brussels, Belgium.  At the time, unknown to him, his brother, Buddy was not far away in an Army supply unit.  My dad also remembered V1's buzzing Shipdham and attacking England.\r\n\r\nI think while servicing \"Tinker Belle\", my dad became an assistant crew chief and received his Sergeants stripes.  I also remember my Dad saying he serviced 10 planes during the war and all of them were destroyed.  I know he serviced \"Margaret Ann\"of the 68th Squadron, the pilot was Lt. Jansen and the crew chief was Bob Toles.  He has a number of photos dedicated as a memorial to her in his scrapbook.\r\n\r\nOne of my Dad's closest friends was Richard Butler nicknamed \"Bucky\".  They went through training rogether.  Bucky eventually became a waist gunner.  During the Kiel raid he was wounded aboard \"Margaret Ann\" losing the middle finger of his right hand.  He returned to duty and was killed 7/11/44 in \"Flak Alley II\" piloted by Lt. Bonnet when the plane ditched in the English Channel.  Although I was named Charles after my grandfather, my Dad nicknamed me \"Bucky\" in memory of his friend.  My middle name is Richard  after Richard Butler.\r\n\r\nMy Dad was very close to an English couple later in the war, Tommy and Mary Spur of Kent.  Apparently, he gave them gifts of American chocolate and other hard to get items, and occasionally he stayed with them while on leave.  I have pictures of them and some letters.\r\n\r\nThe main planes pictured in my Dad's photos are \"Lemon Drop\", \"Captain and His Kids Ride Again\", \"Flak Alley\", \"Rugged Buggy\". \"Margaret Ann\", \"Pistol Packin Mama\", \"Ram It Dammit\", \"Full House\", and \"Tinker Belle\".",

    "bioArrivedHow": "Navigator on Lt. Hawkins' crew.  Our B-24 \"EZ-Duzit\" was delivered to the aircraft pool and we never saw it again.  We proceded from the pool to 44th Bomb Gp. for assignment to the 506th Bomb Sq.  Since Lt. Hawkins suffered from chronic ear problems, after a few missions, along with the bombadier (Lt. MCloud) we were reassigned to Lt. Mendenhall's crew for tour completion.",
    "bioTripDetails": "Passage of years has probably dimmed some recollections of experiences as a crew navigator with the 506th Bomb Squadron, 44th Bomb Group, but I'll never forget 8 APRIL, 1944, EASTER SUNDAY.\r\n\r\nDuring the early morning hours, I was asleep in the four man BOQ room with my crew members (Lt. Hawkins' crew) when my friend, Vernon Brockman (co-pilot on Lt. Marx's crew) crept into the dark room, loudly announcing his presence in response to the charging of my Thompson.  Vernie told me that he was scheduled to fly and that he was going to be shot down and that he wanted me to mail the cigar box he was holding to his wife.  At that time we both had four missions and when I suggested that he talk to the Chaplain about his premonition, he stressed that it wouldn't make any difference, that he was going to be shot down anyway.  I went to breakfast and to the briefing with Vernie, all the time trying to convince him to talk to the Chaplain.  At the briefing I learned that the 44th was leading a maximum 8th AF strike against Brunswick with a feint toward Berlin.  (The briefer emphasized to stay away from a concentration of flak at the Hanover railyards).  As I remember, the 44th lead pilot was a Captain with Ploesti experience and that the Navigator and Bombardier were deemed to be the group's best.  I do not remeber the name of the Command Pilot.  Scheduled in the #3 position off the lead (sometimes referred to as the purple heart corner) was a pilot (Lt. Scuddy) that I had never heard of.  Later I learned that Scuddy's crew needed a Navigator, so being anxious to complete my tour--I volunteered!!  I later learned that SSgt Wallace Robison, a waist gunner on my regular crew had been \"drafted\" as a replacement gunner for Lt. Scuddy's crew.\r\n\r\nThe mission seemed routine until we started the feint toward Berlin and the Luftwaffe mounted  a wolfpack fighter attack against the 44th, diving high from 11:00 and 13:00 o'clock, spraying the formation with 20 mm cannon fire.  (I have never heard an accurate count of the fighters the Luftwaffe used in the attack but saying several hundred would seem safe.)  The exploding 20 mm cannon shells were really a fireworks display.  Some of the fighters passed within a few feet of the formation.  During the attack, the 44th Lead Pilot did violent evasive action, and, to this day, I don't know how Scuddy managed to stay on the lead's wing.  During the excitment, I was thrown against an ammo can, tearing a hole in my flight suit and gashing a superficial wound in my butt (of course my wound healed but all through the years I have kept the torn flight suit as a souvenir).  The nose turret gunner panicked, never firing a shot during the attack and bolting to the flight announcing falsely on the innercom that he had been shot.  At this point in time, I am not sure whether we lost an engine during the fighter attack or on the bomb run.\r\n\r\nVernie Brockman's premonition was right.  He was shot down in a flat sprial.  I was able to count only seven chutes.  I learned later that all ten crew members got out and were captured.\r\n\r\nBattle casualties in the nose of the lead aircraft during the fighter attack probably explains why we made the bomb run on Frankfurt instead of our briefed target at Brunswick.    The briefer was right--there was a concentration of flak around Frankfurt!!  The bomb run with the continuous flak barrage was nerve wracking--possibly more so than the stress endured during the massive air attack prior to the bomb run.  Scuddy did an amazing job of keeping up with the group on three engines.  About every two minutes, one of the the good engines would backfire.  I didn't know Scuddy at the time but I figured he had to be a Texas mule skinner, otherwise, he couldn't have known the language he expressed on the innercom following each engine backfire.  The engine quit on the final approach when power was reduced for landing at our home base.\r\n\r\nFeeling thankful to be safely on the ground didn't ease my agitation re the panicking nose turret gunner.  I wanted to see him court martialed but I was further frustrated when the powers to be didn't seem to be interested.  I later learned a possible reason for their obvious lack of interest was the fact that Lt. Scuddy, contrary to the 44th group policy, had been sent  on a combat mission with his crew without first flying a combat mission as a co-pilot with an experienced crew.\r\n\r\nMy second frustration dealt with our making a bomb run on Frankfurt rather than Brunswick.  Following my challenge, I was told that bomb release photos confirmed my allegation.  (In my later years I have always wonderd if official reports confirmed tht we hit the wrong target--bombing Frankfurt rather than the briefed target).\r\n\r\nAs I recall, the 44th officially reported 11 aircraft shot down.  But the squadron \"scuttlebutt\" was that only 10 of the 39 aircraft initially launched were flyable after battle damage was evaluated.\r\n\r\nDuring the dark days following the 8 April 1944 mission, the 44th was blessed to have top-notch commanders when the chips were down.  Lt. Colonel McTee, 506th Sq, Commander, Colonel Gibson, 44th Commander, and General Johnson, 14th Combat Wing Commander, were commanders who represented ultimate leadership qualities that helped us get through the adversity.\r\n\r\nIn summary, my other combat experiences pale when contrasted with memories of EASTER SUNDAY, 8 APRIL 1944--the mission I identify as \"The Day Blood Ran in the Bomb Bay\".  Each year on 8 april, Wallace Robison and I made telephone contact so that together we can express our thanks for another year of life.",

    "bioArrivedHow": "B-24 to Goose Bay, Lab.; Reykjavik, Icld.; Valley Wales, Northern Ireland.  Following OTU at Chatham, the crew was sent to Langley Field, VA to the 111th Sea Search and Ferry Unit, this was a sub patrol unit being converted to crew assembly and ferrying operations. (We had a little, very little exposure to the above).  We were assigned B24-J. No. 429464 which in our mistaken enthusiasm, we thought, the crew and the bird, were one.  Thus we paid for elaborate nose art and a few bits of customizing: wired in coffee maker (Mr. Kowlson, Chairman of Stewart Warner and a friend of my father's gave us a special set of igniters for heaters (they didn't work above 9000 ft either) and an auxiliary hydraulic pump for the No. 3 engine with a fully shielded commutator, etc.  We lost our bombardier at Langley.  He was eventually replaced by Don Boyette but not until we reached Northern Ireland.  As was the custom of the times after landing at Valley, Wales we no longer were the sole proprietors of the 464.  According to the group roster in Webb Todd's 68th history, it disappeared, it just went into the woodwork.      .",
    "bioTripDetails": "On one of our early missions we were hit with \"AC\" damage resulting in an engine (No. 3) feathered, bombs salvoed through doors that didn't open and a number of in-flight flak alterations that slowed us down so we came back alone low and slow.  Luck was with us and a Tempest II from the RAF picked us up and stayed with us for a while until we got near Luxembourg.  He wished us well and rolled over and bailed out.  When we got back and went through debriefing, we passed along the story and our gratitude and admiration.  We even suggested suitable recognition for services rendered etc.  As I recall, the RAF type that followed up was not too impressed as it seems this lad had been through this act before, he didn't like the Tempest II (it was the king's property, you know) had done extensive pre-war European travel, language skills, etc.  He suggested that being mentioned in dispatches would suffice.\r\n\r\nThe crew was William D. Kelly, Pilot; John J. Ferenz, Co-Pilot; Frank W. Lane, Jr., Navigator; Donald Boyette, Bombardier; George G. Fraga, Engineer; Oliver M. Lopez, Radio Operator; William E, Henderson, Nose Gunner; William J. Hegelein, Gunner; Lester E. Hess, Gunner; and Paul Aragon, Gunner.  We had a total of 32 missions including 3 squadron leads; 4 group leads; 2 deputy division leads (took over lead prior to the bomb line), and 1 deputy air force lead (took over lead during assembly over England).\r\n\r\nOf specific missions:  Col. Lehnhausen's comments on the Leverkuson, Germany raid 18 Oct. '44 and Sgt. George Fraga's account of the Aachen Area mission 16 Nov. '44 as published in the 68th Squadron History, are more objective than I could be and are quoted below:\r\n   \r\n    l.  Col. Lehnhausen, brother of Edward, stated that the 44th Bomb Group filled in a      \r\nformation  with another Group.  It was three 'boxes'and the fourth squadron filled in.  Edward was in the high, right section and Lt. Dayball was in the low left.  Edward was on Lt. Kelly's wing and had a poor navigator who was on his tenth mission.\r\n       When the formation approached the high weather front, they separated to avoid collision.  When Lt. Bakalo's aircraft turned over and went down, it is believed it crashed into Dayball's.  But it is believed that Lehnhausen's ship became separated from all the others and flew over those accurate flak guns and went down.  Edward was buried at Luxembourg, while another was buried at Aachen--so the crew was scattered--but no one knows why.\r\n\r\n    2.  Lt. Kelly in A/C 806 provided the lead for the 491st Bomb Group, 2nd Air Division,\r\n8th Air Force.  Sgt. George Fraga, engineer for Lt. Kelly relates this story: \"I remember we had a full bird Colonel as Command Pilot, a West Pointer, and an all around real Joe.  Lt. Frank W. Lane was our navigator.  We were lead ship for the entire mission and it was a real lousy day.  I used two full cases of double red flares after we broke through the overcast at 18,000 feet trying to assemble the 491st planes for the mission.  It was a maximum effort strike and the Colonel stated that when we dropped our marking flares and bombs and turned away to come home the last ships in the formation had not cleared the coast of England.  I remember, too, that after we had dropped our load and I had closed the bomb bay doors, the Colonel told Lt. Kelly to \"Rack this thing around and let's get the hell out of here\".  The Germans were really blackening the sky with flak and he didn't want any souvenirs.  He was further flabbergasted when, as soon as I got the doors closed our entire crew got on the intercom and sang \"Herr Hitler says we'll never bomb this place\", so we all gave a big raspberry.  The Colonel said he had never seen a nuttier bunch.  Here the Krauts were throwing everything they could at us and we were singing.  I guess that was one way to let go of the tension\".",

Soon learned differently.\r\n\r\nHad to land twice in newly liberated France and once in Belgium.\r\n\r\nOn low level resupply mission on 18 Sept '45, I saw a young girl tending livestock in one of the few un-flooded fields.  She was waving her apron at us.  I have always hoped that she knew that we were the \"Good Guys\", and that she was cheering us on!!  We must have been an awesome sight to her.  Many, many livestock were standing on Dikes with nothing to eat or drink.  Very, very sad scene.\r\n\r\nWe were very proud of our reputation  as a \"Lucky\" crew.  Air crew men who had to make-up missions wanted to  fly with us.\r\n\r\nWe flew numerous aircraft - E+ #542 the most;  also on 3 Feb '45 A+ #672 had an engine shot out, we were lucky to find a group of B-17s below us and we were able to drop under them so we were not alone.\r\n\r\nWe had exceptional ground crews, but we really didn't know them.  Didn't think of it at the time, but over all these years I have really come to appreciate them and I want them to know it.\r\n\r\nOn a very long mission to Dresden via Berlin and Munich (16 Jan 45), we had to land along with many others in newly liberated Paris.  About four or five B-24s in front of us slid off the narrow taxi way and stuck in deep mud.  We were FORCED to spend 4 days in newly liberated Paree!!!\r\n\r\nOn Sept. 18, 1944 we flew a low level supply drop to Best, Holland.  Almost all fields were flooded by retreating Germans.",

Eight months later, on return to ZO1, discovered weekly ration of tobacco at Coast Guard Station at Bluie West Air Field, Greenland was one full box of cigars!  Then started smoking cigars.  Quit smoking altogether some years later when I was older and wiser.\r\n\r\nOfficers of new combat crews at Shipdham Air Base were assigned to fly first combat mission individually with experienced crews.  My first mission was baptism of fire and a real learning experience, but found that it must have been considered just training for me, because it never appeared on my record as a completed mission, while the rest of that crew were credited.\r\n\r\nJan l, 1945 mission to Koblenz was another memorable experience.\r\n\r\nCompleted 29 combat missions, including strategic missions over Hamburg, Kiel, Magdeburg, Koblenz and many others.  We destroyed oil refineries, naval bases, arament factories.  Flew tactical mission eliminating fortifications at Metz in support of Patton.  Repulsed Von Runsted's counter attacks in the Ardennes.  Supported lst Army and British crossing of Rhine and dropped food, ammunition and supplies.\r\n\r\nFlew last mission of the 44th BG.

    "bioTripDetails": "I flew a total of 19 missions.  One of which was the Ploesti raid with Major Beam as pilot, Lt. Michaels, Co-pilot.  Our regular Pilot and Co-Pilot did not make the raid because of illness.  Indelible memory of tracers filling the air on the bomb run made 1 or 2 minutes seem an hour.\r\n\r\nOver Naples the plane straggled we were trailing behind the formation because of a bad engine.  We were shot up badly by fighters, my radio transmitter got a 20 millimeter shell in it.  Our waist gunner Kallal was hit in the stomach but was uninjured, being protected by his flak suit and the huge metal buckle (to snap on a parachute).  Our tail gunner got the purple heart for a shot that took off the toe of his flying boot, but inflicted only a blood blister on him as the shell went past his toe.\r\n\r\nWe were shot down October 1, 1943 over Wiener Neustadt, Austria.  Was taken prisoner XVIIB, Krems, Austria.\r\n\r\nThe memories of crewmates who died October 1, 1943.  These were men I had flown with from the time the 506th was first formed in 1942.  We had lived together, flown together and were a tight knit group.\r\n\r\nBall turret gunner was Richard H. Williams from upstate,NY.  He was our flight engineer and would normally be assigned to the top turret, but he accepted the ball turret assignment which was much more hazardous- because as it turned out for him - if the hydraulic system is shot out then the ball turret cannot be operated to permit the gunner to get our to put on his parachute, so he remains trapped in the ball and goes down with the plane.  The operator of the top turret was E.J. Cutshall, the assistant enginer, who was too big to fit comfortably into the ball turret, so Williams, a nice guy, and much smaller, agreed to take the more dangerous job.  Both our waist gunners were big men, Nick Popovich and Lawrence Kallal, and would have had difficulty in the ball.\r\n\r\nWilliams turned 21 just a couple of weeks before he was killed, and we all had a party celebrating the fact that he had lived long enough to become an adult.\r\n\r\nLarry Kallal, my assistant radio operator, also went down with the plane.  He wore a flak suit which consisted of two large pieces of segmented metal, like a medieval warrior's coat of mail.  The two pieces, one in front and one in back, were separate but tied together at the top, above the shoulder, with a piece of twisted safety wire.  When we were on fire and in the spin downwards Larry tried to undo the twisted safety wire, so he could get out of the flak suit and snap on his parachute, but he turned the twists the wrong way so instead of undoing the twists he was adding to them.  Nick (the other waist gunner) had to jump, and the last thing he recalls is the desperate look in Larry's eyes as he frantically tried to get the safety wire untwisted so that he could bail out.  The tail gunner and bombardier also went down with the plane.",

Parker piloted \"Peepsight\", he flew the number 9 position in the second squadron, led by Lt. Richard D. Butler.  The Group Leader was Lt. Shelby L. Irby with Lt. Col. Dexter L. Hodge, Command Pilot.  Approaching the IP, the formation was engaged by approximately twenty enemy aircraft.  Despite continuous attacks a good bomb- run was made. Attacks were resumed as the formation made the turn away from the flak covered target area and Peepsight received direct hits approximately half way from the target to the coast.  Hits were sustained in the right wing, number four engine, right and left waist sections, top and tail turrets.  Control cables and instrument panel were damaged and the oxygen system was knocked out.  The ship had to fall out of formation and drop to lower altitude because of the wounded and lack of oxygen. The wounded were Lt. D.R. Simons, Co-pilot; Lt. E. L. Rutherford, navigator; T/Sgt. D. L. Lieck, radio operator; and S/Sgts. Covane, Hardwick and Sorrow, gunners.  Lt. Parker was slightly wounded, but not too seriously to bring the battered bomber back to base and land it with a flat tire.",

From Cluntoe flew in B-24 with crew of 5 and 39 passengers (including Henry's four officers) to Horsham St, Faith, a B-24 base in the 96th Combat Wing.  After a good meal and arrival of our enlisted men on another B-24, we were taken by a pair of trucks from the 44th BG to Shipdham.",
    "bioTripDetails": "After graduating from Turner Field 10 Nov. 1942, I was sent to Maxwell Field, Montgomery, AL.end of Nov. 1942 for Instructor training in the Vultee BT-13 until the end of January.  During the second week of training, one of my Ground School Instructors invited me to his home for dinner and to meet a lovely Southern Belle who was staying with him and his wife.  We became enamoured with each other and I missed seeing her 4 nights until I transferred to Bainbridge Army Air Field, Bainbridge, GA the end of January 1944 to \r\ninstruct aviation cadets in Basic Flying Training. I asked The Southern Belle, Mary Lanier, to marry me 13 Aug. 1943.  The marriage was consummated 1 May 1945 about two weeks after returning from the ETO.\r\n\r\nFlew 32 combat missions with the 44th BG from 2 Jun 1944 until Mar 1945.  (Except 16 days lead crew training in Aug. 1944 at 93rd BG Hardwick, Eng.). The original crew flew together except nose gunner who caught a piece of flak in the groin.  (He recovered and was sent to Italy to finish his tour.) Crew returned home safely in April 1945.  So did the nose gunner whom I have seen at Second Air Division Association Conventions several times since we got back.\r\n\r\nThe one mission that sticks in my memory above all others was #19 on 18 Sept. 1944 to Best, Holland.  We were carrying supplies for airborne troops who landed there 17 Sept. 1944.  It was a most wonderful mission and none of us would have missed it for the world.  We went into the target on top of trees.  Dutch civilians were waving like mad as we went past; waving Dutch Flags, British Flags, and anything they could find.  Cattle were running wild all over the place.   The entire western end of Holland for 50 miles inland was flooded by Nazis.  We pulled to 500 feet over target area and parachuted supplies (ammo, food, medicine) to troops, then back down to deck again.  We did now see any opposition, but discovered  on return to Shipdham a .30 cal. hole in leading edge of wing.  It cut electric line to #1 and #2 manifold pressures and put a hole in the gas tank, which was leaking badly in the bomb bay.  Some others had it worse, engines, hydraulics, etc. shot out.  One ship ditched in North Sea, saw only 3 men getting out of it.  We flew with 66th Squadron as Deputy Lead of 3rdSquadron K+279.  The mission lasted 5 l/4 hours.\r\n\r\nMission #25 was to Ahrweiler, Germany (6 hours) for which we received a citation from General Johnson.\r\n\r\nMission #29 on 16 Jan 1945 was to Dresden, Germany.  On the return trip, we were advised that the weather was bad over England and we could continue on the Scotland or land at Orly, France just outside of Paris.  Practically the whole group suddenly discovered that we did not have enough gas to reach Scotland and landed at Orly.  Many crews flew back to Shipdham in a day or two, but it took three or four days to to get our plane off the ground!\r\n\r\nA happy memory occurred in England.  During the time I was an Instructor at Bainbridge, GA, I made the acquaintance of a Pilot Officer (now deceased) from England.  He was also an instructor there.  We became good friends but he returned to England before I went over for my combat tour.  One night while walking down the main street in Norwich, in a blackout, with some of my crew.  I heard this fellow laughing down a side street.  His laugh was unmistakable (a-how, a-haw, a-haw) and I hollered \"Smitty\" and he hollered \"Henry\".  We got together then and a couple of times at his home.  He came to the USA to see me on my 65th birthday.",

An interesting coincidence, I flew 32 missions in WWII and spent 32 years with General Motors.\r\n\r\nI stayed in the Air Force Reserve until 23 May 1961 and was promoted to Major USAFR 1 Jul 1955.\r\n\r\nSince 6 Nov. 1974, our home has been a condominium in the adult community of Rossmoor, Jamesburg, NJ.",

I arrived in England without a crew and it took me seven weeks before I was assigned to the 44th Bomb Group on 5/3l/44, 6 days before D-Day.  I never saw the crew I trained with in the states again nor do I know what happened to them.\r\n\r\nIt took me from 5/3l/44 to 8/12/44 before I flew my first mission.  I was fortunate that my first mission was with a crew (Lt. Paul Durett) that was short 2 gunners and had many missions yet to fly.  I joined their crew and flew approximately 25 missions with them, flying mostly, the \"Tinker Belle\" (Serial #44-40158).  I had flown 3l missions when I was informed my tour of combat was complete.\r\n\r\nSpecific Mission Comments:\r\n\r\n My 2nd mission (8/13/44) was a troop support mission to Rouen, France.  One of our planes was shot down and we lost an engine before hitting the target.  We dropped out of formation and returned to England. \r\n\r\nMy 9th mission (9/30/44) to Hamm, Germany, we lost one plane.\r\n\r\nMy 12th mission (10/7/44) to Kassel, Germany, we lost 2 planes and one landed in Brussels, Belgium.\r\n\r\nMy 14th mission (10/25/44) to Gezsenkirchen, Germany, we lost one plane\r\n\r\nMy 15th mission (10/30/44) to Hamburg, Germany was very scary, Bad weather caused the formation to break up.  The lead plane in our element was lost.\r\n\r\nMy 20th mission (12/5/44) to Munster, Germany, we lost one plane.\r\n\r\nMy 24th mission (12/28/44) to Kaiserlauten, Germany, we lost three planes, one abortedthemission but crashed at our base, killing all aboard.\r\n\r\nMy 28th mission (1/13/45) to Kaiserlauten, Germany, we lost one plane.",

    "bioArrivedHow": "A New B-24 with entire crew to Preswick, Scotland.Trip is described in detail under Personal Experiences.",
    "bioTripDetails": "In Lincoln, Nebraska, we received orders to proceed to England and the 8th Air Force, specifically the 44th Bomb Group.  We were given a new B-24 and we were directed to fly the North Atlantic route.\r\n\r\nThe next day was a Sunday, September 26, 1943.  We left about dawn and our destination:  Presque Isle, Maine.  Next morning we took off on our second leg to Goose Bay, Labrador.  At Goose Bay Mac, Callaway and I went to a special briefing in flying the North Atlantic.  We landed at Keflavic, Iceland in late afternoon the next day.  I remember it as a dismal barren place.  After a short sleep we took off for the UK.  Our destination:  A very large base at Prestwick, located on the west coast of Scotland about 700 miles from Iceland.\r\n\r\nAt takeoff the weather was clear with an excellent view of the mountains on the south coast of Iceland.  We were routed to fly at about 7000 feet.  About halfway to Scotland, the weather became dicey and we went into the overcast at about 7000 feet.  We had been briefed to make land fall at Stornoway, where there was a radio beacon which triggered a light on the instrument panel in the cockpit when the aircraft passed directly over the field.  When the light came on I turned to the briefed southwest heading and then listened eagerly for the sound of radio transmission which would identify the north leg of the radio range coming out of Prestwick.  We flew for a time and I thought I heard the range transmission .  After five or ten minutes had elapsed, the beam I thought I was hearing disappeared.  In effect, I had followed a false beam which was often transmitted in mountainous country.  By now it was night and I was only interested in finding a landing field and certainly none was in sight.  We were lost over unfamiliar country.  With my stupid turning, Callaway had no way of locating us.\r\n\r\nI should add that we had not seen sky, water or land since we entered the clouds at 7000 feet when halfway to the UK.  to make matters worse, we could not make voice radio contact with the ground station and Dick Hershey, our radio operator faired no better on his wireless.  So what to do?  We climbed up ten to twelve throusand feet hoping to get above the stuff so that Jim could take a star fix.  But no luck.  The clouds were just too high and we couldn't clear them.  So I decided to fly a due west course for a time that would be long enough for us to clear the mountainous area and get us out over the ocean.  We did that and then let down.  We finally broke out below the clouds at about a hundred feet, we then turned around and headed on a due east course looking for land and, hopefully for a landing field.  I could see the mainland while we staggered along at 100 feet or so, but no landing field.  We reached an estuary and started up until the walls started to close in. So back we went over the ocean and climbed to 7000 feet.  It started to rain like a tropical thunderstorm rain, with plenty of lightning as well.  Hershey was still working his wireless, and then he leaned over my shoulder and said the words that we had been dying to hear, \"I reached a ground station, and they would give us headings to fly\".  As I learned to appreciate, the British were ingenious at creating primitive systems to guide and rescue airmen in distress,I remember it vividly.  We were on a south course and had not seen the ground or sky for four or five hours, except for that time under the overcast.  On the south heading, believe it or not, we finally broke out in the clear.  The stars were shining overhead, the landscape below us was visible.  Directly below us, was a small landing strip, we peeled off quickly and landed.  I didn't know the British lighting system and there was a light line directly across the runway.  I assumed that was the first point of touchdown.  I learned later that that was the LAST point of touchdown.  I landed beyond that so no wonder, I had to stand on the brakes to get us stopped.\r\n\r\nYears later when I watched the Pope landing in a country for the first time, kneeling and kissing the ground.  I knew exactly what that kind of sensation produces.  There were ten of us who did exactly the same thing.  We had landed at a tiny RAF field in Ayr, which was Bobby Burns hometown.  We were the only airplane to get into a field in that area that night and we were weathered in for SEVEN FULL DAYS!!.  We could not get out and there was no air activity because the weather was so bad.  On the eighth day a bomber from the 44th Bomb Group came up and led us and a few others to the 14th Combat Wing to which we were all assigned.\r\n\r\nOur first mission was November 18, 1943, the target, a Fochwolfe factory in Norway about 50 plus miles north of Oslo.  The route was 750 miles all directly over the North Sea.  We flew a loose formation all the way, tightening up a bit as we passed the coast of Norway.  From there we flew north of Oslo, bombed the target, turned and headed south to Sea.\r\n\r\nSince I had been working the throttles pretty good in the ragged formation on the way up, and since we were also having super charger trouble, I was uneasy about how much fuel we had remaining.  I asked Vickers, our Engineer, \"How many gallons?\"  He said, \"700\".  \"Seven hundred\", I yelled, \"that's impossible!  We started up with 2700 gallons and now we've just got 700 to get home\".  \"Well\", said Vickers, \" gauges are kind of hard to read but maybe we have 750 gallons left\".  Well, what the hell to do.  How could we ever get back so far on so little?  I asked Callaway for a heading to the nearest airfield in Sweden.  As I recall it, we were very close to the Swedish border.  He checked and gave a heading to an airport which was about 75 to 100 miles away.  I thought and prayed.  I got everybody on the intercom and we talked.  Our first mission--Sweden meant internment for the balance of the war; hell, we wouldn't get any mail from home and the scavengers would steal all of our personal things at the base.  We were unanimous.  LETS GO FOR IT!!\r\n\r\nClearly we could not stay with the formation, so I throttled back and we began to fall behind.  About this time we passed over the coast.  Suddenly I saw streams of colored lights, all rising from below.  I dropped the left wing and look down.  There, about seven thousand feet below us were several gun boats.  They were firing bullets and they were intended for us.  So we got out of there as quickly as we could.  We headed south, southwest over a body of water called the Skagerrak and picked up a heading for home.  The weather was clear, the visibility was excellent.  I leaned out the gas mixture so far as I dared, so that we were mushing along nose high at about 135 to 140 miles an hour.  We relaxed and talked and about every two minutes asked Vickers for a reading on the sight gauges.  So it went for about an hour, then someone yelled on the intercom \"Fighters at 7 o'clock high!\" I knew that they were German, but from where did they come?  That is when I learned a geography lesson I've never forgotten.  The water between the Danish peninsula and the south coast of Norway is called Skagerrak.  I think that at the narrowest point it is about 100 miles wide.  We had to pass between the two points.  They jumped us, the straggler low on fuel and almost a cripple.  We were a natural  target.  We wanted out of the area as soon as possible, but the more speed we made the more fuel we consumed.  We played hide and seek with the Germans as they made passes and fired at us.  When they came in from the front, we turned into them and whenever possible we turned into the nearest friendly cloud.  So it went for 30 minutes.  Eventually, the fighters had to turn for home; they also had fuel problems.  We continued on looking at the cold, cold sea and the sight gauges.\r\n\r\nWe then threw overboard everyhing that was loose or that the crew could pry loose from the aircraft except the crew and our parachutes, and we PRAYED! At long last we saw the British coast on the horizon.  It was nearly dark and as we approached the field we saw British bombers taking off.  I later learned that this was the first time that the British had bombed Berlin and the planes taking off were part of that attack.  We fired flares.  The British gave way and we landed.  Vickers made his regular check of the remaining fuel supply.  Following the usual practice he put the calibrated dip stick in every tank.  In every tank the dip stick came up dry.  Thank you God, AMEN!  The RAF gave us dinner, bed and fuel.  But most of all they lent us a runway.  Next day we flew home to Shipdham.  \r\n\r\nWelcome to the ETO.  I wondered if the next 24 were going to be like this.",

    "bioTripDetails": "On July 28, 1943 we flew to Africa and landed at Marakesch and then on to Tripoli.  We were trying to reach the 44th Bomb Group at Benghazi.  We were sent back to England, the group had bombed the Polesti Oil Field.\r\n\r\nWe made one bombing mission in Germany, then sent back to Africa.  This time to Oudna-One Air Base close to Tunis, Tunisis.  We made one bombing mission to Pisa.  I took pictures of the bombing run, had a good shot of the leaning tower.  Then we were returned to England.  \r\n\r\nSeptember 24, 1943 we bombed Pisa, Italy.\r\n\r\nOn November 5, 1943, our mission was to Munster, Germany.  We had lost of flak and ME 109 Fighters.  After the bomb run our Bombadier Lt. James MacDonald got in the nose turret.  Later on a piece of flak hit him in the head.  I helped out and replaced him.  He was able to make it to the flight deck behind the pilot.  Again he was hit this time in the leg.  Our fuel was low and we had to land in a field just inside the English Coast.\r\n\r\nOn January 21, 1944 our 13th mission, the target was a V1 Bomb Base at St. Agatha D'Aliermont and Escalles Sur Buchy.  Our target had heavy cloud cover, Col. Dent said go around again.  On the 2nd run we were hit with heavy flak and FW190 fighters.  We were the lead plane on the last group of seven planes.  The first plane to go down was  #6 piloted by Lt. Hartwell Howington, next was the #5 plane, Pilot Lt. Alfred Starring.  On the fifth run #2 and #3 went down.  #3 plane's Pilot was Lt. Frank Sobotha, and #2 Pilot was Lt. Bary Mathisen.  Four planes from the 68th and one from the 66th were lost.  Our Pilot, Lt. Sam Williams, was hit on the left side of his head near his left eye by a 20 mm bullet.  Our Co-Pilot Stanley Reich took over and flew the plane back tothe base.  Williams was eventually sent back to the states.\r\n\r\nMost of our crew had completed their 30 missions.  John Carstens and I had 4 more to go.  I was assigned to a new crew, the Pilot, Lt. Anderson.  On jour first mission we went to Zeitz, Germany.  As we went over the French Coasst we were hit with flak.  Finally had to shut down #2 engine.  The pilot called me (an old pro by now) to see what was the best thing to do.  Since we were far into Germany, I suggested we drop our bombs and stay with the group.  After the bomb run we were using too much fuel to keep up with the group.  Two P-47 pick us up and stayed with us for 30 minutes.  Finally we dropped to 8,000 ft. in an attempt to get to the base.  We did not have enough fuel to make it.  I told him aabout the other base we had landed on another mission.  The navigator found it on the map and we dropped to 500 ft. just in case we had to ditch.  We had good luck and landed at the air base, as we were taxing to park.....WE RAN OUT OF FUEL.  Another plane was sent to pick us up and I finished my missions on May 21, 1944.\r\n\r\nOn January 21, 1944 we made 5 bomb runs on the target - Pasde Calies, FR.  Pilot was hit in left side of face.  We also lost four planes from the 68th Sqdn.\r\n\r\nMarch 6, 1944 we bombed Berlin.\r\n\r\nOn three different occasions we had to land in Southern England due to Engine failure and low on gas.",

Next we flew to Prestwick, Scotland, then to Valley, Wales. Our plane was taken from us and we went by train to Stone, England.  From there flew to Clintoe, Ireland, then on to Shipdham.",
    "bioTripDetails": "I was drafted in November 1941 and assigned to an Anti-Aircraft Battery.  It goes without saying, the country was totally unprepared for war (which came on December 7, 1941)  Our operation was totally secret, and it amounted to patrolling the Atlantic coast.  I was based in Washingon D.C., and served ten months on active duty before being assigned to Scott Field for Radio School, later to a crew and on to the ETO.\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed that experience.  In fact, I enjoyed all my service experience, except when the Germans were shooting at us.\r\n\r\nOn June 6, 1944 we were waked at 2:00 AM with shouts \"The Invasion is On\".  Our \r\nfirst mission was July 6, 1944   A bomber assembly plant, at Bernburg, Germany,it was our worst mission.  Approximately 60 planes abreast came at us from l:00 o'clock.  There were 200 holes in the plane when we got back, but the crew was totally intact.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne memorable mission was over Munich, July 21, 1944.  We had to make a second run as a formation of B-17's were making their run exactly opposite to ours.  After the second run, we still had our bombs.  We dived into a cloud bank and when we emerged we were totally alone and low on gas.  I got a radio fix, we opened the bombbay doors and dropped the bombs, then headed to Shipdham.  We landed with 15 gals. of gas left in each engine.\r\n\r\nOn August 5, 1944 our target was Brunswick, Germany.  Visibility was unlimited, not a cloud in the sky, but you couldn't see the bombers ahead for the flak.  More than any target we'd hit so far, I've never felt the concussion as I did that day.  When we opened the bombbay doors, the flaps on my helmet were rising and falling with the concussion of the explosions (I never fastened my chin straps).  One shell tore several holes in our bombbay, knocked out the hydraulic system.  The doors closed on what fluid remained, sparing us the trouble of the trouble of cranking them closed.  When we reached the Channel and dropped to a lower altitude, Woodie and I went back to the bombay and found the hydraulic lines were full of holes.  Woodie cranked the landing gear down for us to land.  After we landed we learned that flak had hit the #2 engine and crushed the exhaust pipe about 15\", but did not enter the engine.\r\n\r\nI have the greatest admiration for the English people, many of their characteristics amazed me, as we likewise probably amazed them.  They were ploddingly slow at their work but their courage and stamina were admirable.  When an air raid signal sounded, American servicemen went into an air raid shelter.  English people continued to sit around drinking tea, as though nothing was happening.  I was also touched to see English children raiding our garbage cans to eat our discarded food.  Some children 12-13 years old had never seen an orange.  We liked their Fish and Chips.  Perry brought them to me from town wrapped in a newspaper.\r\n\r\nLooking back, I feel the Beiber Crew was charmed.  I am proud to have served the greatest of all nations and grateful I flew with the greatest of all Crews.",

    "bioTripDetails": "January 3, 1944- SPAM AGAIN!  Its taste has reached the \"awful disgusting stage\"!  I worry about my folks and their worries over me, but my prayers with theirs, should keep me in good hands.  and there is Helen's too.  I felt wonderfully protected.\r\n\r\nAfter six missions I was assigned from the 392nd to the H2X Pathfinder (over cloud) Navigation/Bombing Training Center, 482nd Bomb Group, Alconbury, England (near Cambridge).  On completion of the training I was assigned to the 44th Bomb Group, 14th Combat Wing, Shipdham, England, and to the Lead Crew of Captain \"Mac\" McCormick.  In my experience Mac was the finest person both personally and as a Lead Pilot to which I could have been assigned.  After he completed his 30 missions, I was pleased to fly as Lead PFF Navigator with other fine Lead Pilots.\r\n\r\nIt was Mac who was chosen as Lead Pilot of the 14th Combat Wing on \"D-Day\" with General Leon Johnson on board.  It was totally overcast.  Now looking back, I know the lead seconds that we were given were too many, and 2 seconds would have been sufficient.  The shore line stood out sharp on the scope, but in this I never knew how strung out we were, hopefully none.  More time, too, should have been devoted to the release procedure automatic or visual, if possible, sighting on our lead plane.  This key factor was not mentioned in the briefing as I recall, only the warning -  DO NOT DROP SHORT.\r\n\r\nI remember the 200th Mission Party held at the 44th BG at Shipdham.  On that day the 14th Combat Wing Commander, General Leon Johnson had decreed that for that day, the officers would honor the enlsited men by removing their officer insignia, and if any officer was caught with his on he would be dealt with  by being thrown in the Base Duck Pond. What a fun day.  I can't believe it really happened!  Maybe after all these years it is only a dream!!\r\n\r\nAbout noon, General Johnson drove up into the center of the station, AS THE CHAUFFEUR with his Sergeant (driver) sitting in the back seat smoking a big cigar.  As the General got out to open the back door for the Sergeant, someone noticed there was one star left on the General's shirt.  They were all laughing along with the General and shouted \" To the Duck Pond\", and with a neat toss he sailed in with a splash.  He came out laughing and I believe everyone clapped and sang \"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow\". \r\n\r\nI was aboard many aircraft but I do not recall a single name.  I did not have any aircraft lost to the point of being in need of ditching.  Many of the planes had flak or fighter damage, especially flak.  I was amazed, while bombing a site in the Potsdam RR Marshalling Yards(06-24-1944) near Berlin,  the flak seemed thick like smoke about 5000 feet below our plane.  Over some sites like the Ruhr Valley, the anti-aircraft explosions were so close that our planes would rock and bounce.\r\n\r\nI often think of the combat crews and how young they were, average age, my guess 21 or less.  My own more like 26.  Whether they wanted to or not they flew.  They did not show any signs of shirking nor seeking any excuse not to go, as they listened to the briefings on the target or targets for the day. These targets were often terrible targets to fly into, the Ruhr Valley (the industrial center of Nazi Germany), to Frankfort, Wesermonde, Munich, Schweinfurt, Berlin, to aircraft factories, huge rail yards, over flak batteries, through the home land of the Luftwaffe.\r\n\r\nI have seen the American Cemetaries at Cambridge, England and in Normany, France and Belgium; name after name of America's finest , so many in their 20's (some older) with their home town addresses from all over the United States.\r\n\r\nOn my return to the US, I visited Malvern, Iowa, the home of Capt. McCormick, Lead Pilot, 66th Sqdn.  My first lead pilot until he completed his mission.  To my sorrow, I found out that one of his stateside assignments was ferrying Distinguished Officers and Visitors.  His last assignment ended in crashing into a cloud covered mountain in South America.  One of the higher ranking officers was at the controls.  Burial was in Arlington.",

A few of the crew members on 48 hour passes managed to get back to Shipdham before take off but were too late to be considered for the raid.  One of them was Major Howard \"Pappy\" Moore. \r\n\r\nThe regular crew were re-assigned for the Kiel mission.  I was Suzy \"Q\"s usual co-pilot but took the pilots seat aboard Miss Delores, a new Liberator which had sat at dispersal for some time.  Lieutenant Hartley \"Hap\" Westbrook would fly co-pilot.\r\n\r\nCaptain Bob Bishop, the navigator, plus seven others, all from the Suzy Q , completed the scratch crew of Miss Delores or Q for Queenie as it was known because of her call letter, Gilbert \"Gibby\" Wandtke, the engineer, was not happy about the change in aircraft. He had been jilted by a Delores in the States and claimed Miss Delores would probably take them over the target but would not bring them back!\r\n\r\nWe were shot down on this mission after bombing France and Germany.

    "bioTripDetails": "I have written four volumes on my career in the US Army Air Force.  The following stories and account of one combat mission with the 8th AF were taken from these volumes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   ARRIVAL IN THE ETO MARCH, 1944\r\n\r\nAfter having flown the South Atlantic route from the United States (ZO1), we landed March 7,1944 in Wales.  Within 48 hours we were transferred to Qulanto in Northern Ireland, South of Belfast.  This was a pre-combat orientation, theater indoctrination and combat assignment training base.  Our stay was six weeks of duration before going on to England.  All officers were warned to guard their .45 pistol with their lives or we would be court martialed if we let one of the IRA members steal it.  I attended  navigation class and was trained to use the Gee Box which was a short range Loran but very very accurate in locating ones position anywhere in the British Isles.  This navigational aid used computations based on the time lag in signals received from two widely spaced transmitting stations to give an exact position.  Later when I became a lead navigator and squadron navigator, our Plane \"Lily Marlene\" was especially equipped for my navigation with the Gee Box.\r\n\r\nOne day we were told we could expect an inspection by none other than General James Doolittle, himself.  The same General who lead the famous B-25 raid over Tokyo in 1942.  We were told to be at our training area and to act as if we did not expect an inspection.  I was at my Gee Box training desk, about every 10 minutes and then 5 minutes, then 2 minutes and finally a minute, someone would stick his head in the door to announce where the General was and when to expect him.  Of course, we all looked like hard working trainees when General Doolittle did arrive. He stepped in the door, our instructor bellowed out, \"Attention\".  The General walked slowly around the room, asking a question or two concerning our training.  Finally he reached my position, he stopped with his face not 12 inches from mine, looked me right in the eyes but never said a work.  Need I say we got very little training in that day.\r\n\r\nThe base was on the south side of a large lake, Belfast was on the north side. The Irish people liked to sail on the lake.  One of our boyish tricks was to fly our B-54 bomber low over the water and buzz the sail boats.  We thought it was great sport to blow the boats over with our prop wash.  I suspect the Irish boaters thought otherwise. Anyway they looked mad.\r\n\r\nMost of the orientation lectures draw a blank in my memory, they were generally on what to expect when we joined our Combat Group or how to keep good relations with our English hosts.  One lecture was on the evils of V.D.  This was a Flight Surgeon giving the talk who said flat out, avoid all sex.  He paused, then said, \"Now after you've done it, here is how to use your profolactics\".\r\n\r\nThe lecture that stands out was the one concerning the number of combat missions required to complete one's tour of combat duty.  Some fool stood up and asked what were the odds.  The lecturer responded thusly, \"On an verage, mission after mission flying against the Nazi fortress of Europe, the 8th Air Force lost four out of every hundred planes, ie.4%.  Of course some would be \"milk runs\" with no loss but others would be a disaster due to very aggressive enemy action\".  He reasoned, a crew that flies 25 missions has a 100% chance of being shot down on their last mission.  A great quiet fell over the room.  For many including myself, this was the first time it had dawned on us we were not playing for marbles. Someone could get hurt.  Up to now, we were just big boys playing with expensive toys, not a care in the world nor a thought of danger.  This was a sobering  thought, how can anyone expect to survive such odds?  Our speaker quickly added that in reality many would go on to complete their tour due to the laws of probability.  I estimated later that one third would.  Our crew kept a record of the 18 crews that trained together and came overseas together.  Sure enough, six of us completed the tour which was raised to 30 missions by them.\r\n\r\nWe lived in Nissen huts which held about 16 officers each.  The front door was inset so a bunk would just fit between the door inset and the rounded walls.  I slept in one of these bunks.  There was a pot belly stove in the center of the building.  On our way over the South Atlantic, our bombadier, John Warga, bought a 5 gallon wooden barrel of whisky while we were in Fortalaga, Brazil.  Warga and our belly gunner, C. J. Alexander ( who we all called Swoose after the popular song of the day \"Alexander the Swoose\") were the whiskey drinkers in our crew but even they could not drink the Brazilian rot gut as it was too strong.  The only thing it was fit for was to start the coal fire in the stove, it must have been 500 proof as it was as effective as gasoline.\r\n\r\nI went to bed early one evening as we had a navigational training flight out over the North Atlantic in the morning at day break.  I needed rest as did Charles Peritti, our pilot, for the lond, difficult and dangerous flight.  I had just gotten to sheep when bombardier Warga and some of his drinking buddies came into the hut after a night out on the town.  Needless to say, they were loaded and noisy.  Those of us trying to sleep asked them to leave so we could rest.  Instead Warga broke out his keg of Brazilian whiskey and they all started drinking it.  Before long, the lot of them had literally gone wild.  I got out of bed and tried to reason with them.  Getting back in bed I yelled at them to shut up and let us get some rest.  This was a big mistake on my part as all reason had left them.  One of the guys picked up the keg of whiskey and held it over my head.  I pulled the covers over my face and he said if I opened my mouth once more he would pour the whiskey on me and set it afire.  I believed him as the whole lot were crazy.  Not another word did they hear from me, I was really scared.\r\n\r\nFinally, Warga and his buddies left to go to the adjacent hut.  They were making a terrible noise by this time.  The men in the next hut were not as kind to this wild bunch as we had been.  A fight broke out and Warga, who was as strong as an ox, picked upa steel cot and threw it the whole length of the Nissen hut.  They forced every one out but Warga who kept pressing against the door as they pushed him out.  Some how his head became wedged between the door and the frame with several men pushing against the door.  One of the guys picked up a baseball bat and began to beat him senseless.\r\n\r\nThe MP's came and arrested the rowdy lot.  Warga was unconscious so they took him to the hospital.  We did fly the mission the next day.  The date was April 6th in a B-214 H, but I had never been so tired.  When we got back, we went to the hospital to visit Warga.  He was a mess.  We could not recognize him as his head was all bandaged and his face swollen and distorted out of shape, especially his eyes.  He spent several days in the hospital and informed me he would be court-martialed.  Everytime we visited him, I would ask if he wanted another drink of Brazilian whiskey.  Just the mention of the stuff would make him shudder.  Not only had he been hurt physically but he had gotten deathly ill from the consumption of that devilish brew.\r\n\r\nWarga was never court-martialed.  We received orders to proceed to England for combat duty.  Since we were leaving soon, the base commander felt Warga had suffered enough for his indiscretion, all charges were dismissed.  We took the keg of Brazilian whiskey to England with us and continued to use it to light fires.  It sat on a shelf in full view of Warga but never again did he think of touching a drop.  Needless to say, we never let him forget the event as long as the whiskey lasted.\r\n\r\nWhile in Northern Ireland, the crew went to Belfast twice.  We rode the train and also a double decker bus.  On one trip I left my Kodak box camera on the bus seat when we got off.  When I realized what I had done, I ran to the next stop and retrieved my camera.  I was the only member of the crew with any way to record our experiences in photo form and I took many, many pictures later at our combat base that nothing else could have duplicated.\r\n\r\nIn Belfast, we had our first experience at a British dance hall.  The floor was very large with several hundred couples dancing.  Where as Americans dance in a small area of the floor, maybe getting around the whole floor once to a dance number, the British move fast, almost run, with the whole floor of couples moving like a wheel.  They did not seem to like to talk much or carry on a conversation like American couples.  However, they will all burst out in song if a catchy tune gets their attention.  This was our first experience of a mixed group singing a song that to us seemed a little off color in mixed company.  The title was \"Roll Me Over in the Clover.\"  It went thusly:\r\n                                                    \r\n                                                            Now this is number one\r\n                                                            and the fun has just begun\r\n                                                            Roll me over, lay me down\r\n                                                            and do it again\r\n                                                            Roll me over, in the clover\r\n                                                            Roll me over, lay me down\r\n                                                            and do it again\r\n\r\nThe second verse started out, \"Now this is number two, what ever shall I do\" etc.  Same with numbers three and four and five and infinitum with some of the verses being very risque.\r\n\r\n                          INCIDENT BETWEEN MISSION NO. 1 AND NO.3  APRIL 23, 1944\r\n\r\nThere were four mess halls at Shipdham Air Base, home for the 44th Bomb Group.  A combat officers and enlisted mens mess and non-combat officers and enlisted mens mess.  No combat mission was flown on April 23rd as we had ground training exercises.  That evening we went to supper, I along with other combat officers ate at our \"Combat Officers Mess\".  We had not been back in the squadron area long before I began to fell faint.  I was th first to become sick so I got a lot of attention.  Medics were called in as I was violently ill.  They rushed me to the base hospital and I was one of the first to be admitted.  I can remember being placed on a hospital bed and at least three or four doctors and orderlies helping me.  The special attention did not last long as the hospital quickly filled to overflow capacity.  Dozens of flying officers began to arrive and soon ther was no place to put them except on the floor.  They were all as sick as myself and complete bedlam and pandemonium broke loose. Needless to say, there was a \"mess\" everywhere.  I did not know at the time we had contacted Ptomaine poisoning from a certain pie served for dessert.\r\n\r\nA new patient was carried in and placed on the floor next to me.  I looked and could not believe my eyes.  The victim was none other than our Group Commander, Colonel John H. Gibson.  I know it sounds strange to anyone who has not experienced it but in war time respect for rank and authority is absolute.  I could not imagine the hospital staff placing Colonel Gibson on the floor while I, a junior officer, lay on a bed.  I spoke up and requested they put him on the bed and let me go on the floor.  Colonel Gibson would have no part of it, he said to me, \"You were here first and you stay on the bed\".  Fortunately, I got well enough to vacate my bed as I was first in and first out.  I got a case of the \"GI's\" two other times during the war and in each case, I was first to become sick and first to recover but neither of these illnesses was as severe as this ptomaine poisoning.\r\n\r\nAs a result of so many combat officers being stricken and the severity of the illness, the missions of the 24th and 25th were scrubbed.  The group did fly to Germany on April 26th and I flew my second mission to Chalons-Sur-Marne on the afternoon of the 27th.\r\n\r\nForty years after this event, I was talking to General Gibson and his wife, Ruth. The occassion was the \"44th Heritage Memorial Group Reunion\" in May 1984 at Dayton, Ohio.  I told the General and Mrs. Gibson my version ofthe event and when I came to the part where the then Colonel Gibson would not let me give him the bed she said, \"It sounds just like John\".  I was also surprised to find out that General Gibson is only 12 years older than myself.  I was 21 years old in April 1944 which means Colonel Gibson was only 33.  All these years since the war I had imagined him to be much older because at the time in 1944, Colonel Gibson was in my minds eye like \"The All Mighty\".\r\n\r\n                               MISSION NO.3 TO BERLIN - APRIL 29, 1944\r\n\r\nToday was to be my third combat mission.  It was Saturday, April 29, 1944.  The first two were not too rough and we were a little too complacent.  At this time, I was not a lead navigator,therefore, not privileged to advance reports as to what the days mission was to be for the 8th Air Force's heavy bombers.\r\n\r\nAfter stumbling through the blackout to the breakfast that morning, the usual question was on everyone's lips, \"Where are we going today\"?  Was it going to be a \"milk run\" over the coast of France or a deep penetration to the heart of Germany?  As we filed into the large Nissen hut used for briefing, the men gathered together, as crews, sitting facing a stage with a huge map of western Europe above it.  Suddenly the command, \"Attention\", was sounded.  In unison, all snapped to their feet and in walked the Commanding Officer, Col. John H. Gibson, and his staff.  The briefing officer stepped forward with a long pointer and the map curtains were quickly drawn open.  At this movement, we all knew what our target was for the day, the ribbons pinned to the map led straight to the heart of Hitler's Germany, the \"Big B\" Berlin.  The howl and commotion could have been heard a block away.        \r\n\r\nFinally, everyone settled down and the briefing officers proceeded to detail our objectives.  The predicted weather, the expected fighter opposition and flak concentrations were outlined.  The various pilots were assigned positions in each section of each squadron of the group.  Some were to lead, others were to be wing men, some were assigned high and others low positions in the formation.  And, of course, someone had to fly coffin corner, low left rear with the least protection from the guns of the fellow planes in the formation.\r\n\r\nThe pilots, bombardiers, navigator, flight engineers, radio men and gunners all went to their own briefing for further details and instructions pretaining to their specific duties.  The pilot was in command of the ship but the success of every mission depended on close teamwork.  No one man, crew, flight squadron, group or Division did it all.  In toto, we were a powerful Air Force out to do battle with a determined enemy.  Our objective was to do maximum damage to today's target.  Theirs was to prevent us from reaching the target or to inflict such painful punishment that we would cease trying.  The stage was set, the battle would soon begin.  Hundreds of men would be either killed, wounded, or missing this day but nothing could stop the mission once it had been set in motion.\r\n\r\nBriefing over, we gathered as crews to be taken by truck out to our planes.  At this time, our crew flew whatever plane was assigned. (Later after we became a lead crew and I a lead navigator, we were assigned a special plane with special navigation equipment, 260 P \"Lili Marlene\")  Now became an extremely tense period before each mission. We would busy ourselves preparing for flight, each man checking what pertained to him.  At the same time, we kept an eye on the tower. The reason being that if the mission for the day was aborted, a certain colored flare would be sent aloft but if it were \"Go\", a differnt flare color was used, I think it was red but it may have been white as my memory fails me after 40 years.  Today, the mission was go, the engines were started and we mounted the plane.  The moment of truth was at hand, there was no option but to go and only God knew who would return.\r\n\r\nOn both take off and landing, I vacated my forward navigation compartment to stand behind the pilot.  I would hold on to a steel protection plate at his back.  This gave me an excellent view of take off and landing.  If a crash situation were to develop, I was to sit on the floor with my back to the steel plate, my knees pulled up and my hands behind my head which I would brace also against the steel bulkhead.  (Fortunately I only had need for this once when coming back from Berlin on my 21st mission, our hydraulic system to the nose wheel was shot out and we skidded nose first down the runway badly damaging the bomb sight and navigation compartment).\r\n\r\nThe 44th sent 21 planes up this day with no aborts.  Now came one of the most frightening parts of every sortie.  As I stood behind the pilot, Lt. Peritti, he would work our way down a long cue of bombers until it was our turn to take off.  He would go through his check list and he and co-pilot Lt. Palmer would shove all four throttles full forward.  Ever so slowly, we would accelerate but at the same time eating up runway.  The plane would be loaded with 2700 gallons of hi-octane gasoline and 6 to 8000 pounds of high explosives and incendiaries.  At lift off speed Peritti would pull back on the stick and we would be airborne but just barely.  Still just off the ground and gaining altitude slowly, I could see the trees at the end of the runway getting closer and closer.  At no time did I ever learn not to be apprehensive and actually frightened.  Somehow we always made it by inches over the trees, I believe by defying all laws of physics and gravity.\r\n\r\nAssembly  was an exacting and demanding task both in piloting and navigation.  First by two and threes and finally by squadrons, all the planes came together to form a group of approximately 21 to 36 planes.  The lead navigators job was to have us over a designated spot at a specific zero time headed in the right direction.  In this manner we formed squadrons into groups, groups into wings, wings into Air Divisions and Air Divisions into the Mighty Eighth Air Force. From beginning to end, we would extend over 100 miles in a straight line through the sky.  With the contrails forming at the wing tip of hundreds of planes, the beauty of the sight would have to be seen to be comprehended.\r\n\r\nIt was 0730 hours and we were off to Berlin.  According to \"Stars and Stripes\", our ETO Newspaper, this was the heaviest daylight assault in history on any one target.  The Force was made up of 600 four motor bombers carrying almost l500 tons of explosives and incendaries.  We were escorted by another 814 fighters, P-5l Mustangs, P-47 Thunderbolts and P-38 Lightnings.  But the Germans were ready with some of the heaviest opposition encountered to date on daylight operations.  One wing alone reported being attacked by at least 200 Nazi fighters.  The Germans used ME 109's and FW 190's as their principle fighters, sometimes ME 210's.\r\n\r\nThe resisance met by the various elements of the massive bomber fleet varied widely.  Fortunately the 44th Bomb Group was well known by the Luftwaffe pilots as being a seasoned combat outfit and best let alone as long as there were less experienced groups that would be an easier target.  A number of German intercepters did test us however, approximately 30 on the way to Berlin and 40 to 50 on the way out.  My most vivid memory of the war was burned on my mind when we were approximtely halfway to Berlin.  I can still close my eyes and after forty years see it again and will until death takes the last light from my sight.\r\n\r\nWhat I am about to record sounds so incredible that I blame no one who wishes to disbelieve.  As God is my witness, I tell the truth.  Over my ear phones came the voice of Paul Corlew, our engineer and top turret gunner, \"Fighters high at One O'Clock\".  I looked out of my astro-dome and saw three German fighters circling.  One could almost hear the lead Nazi pilot say, \"Watch me boys, I'll show you how it is done\". He peeled off into a wide arc so he was at an altitude headed straight for our formation.  At this, I switched positions so I could look out of my right bubble window which afforded and excellent view forward, down and to the whole right of our line of flight.  As the interceptor flew towards us, be began to slow roll.  I became very fearful as I was looking down his two 20mm wing cannons and with each burst, I saw the orange-red flash of the guns.  He appeared to be aimed directly at me and I could not help but wonder where the shells were going.  I fully expected the next one to explode in my navigation compartment.  I was extremently fearful and yet spellbound at the same time.\r\n\r\nBut what followed the next second or so really put fear into me.  As the scoundrel slow rolled towards us, closing at rapid speed, I really became upset.  It appeared to me that he was going to crash into our plane with a head on collision.  I was petrified with fear.  Then suddenly the pilot lifted his wings in a vertical position so he could slice between our right wing tip, he just missed it by inches.\r\n\r\nAn awesome sight caught my attention.  At the base of the wing of the adjacent plane, right at the inboard motor and fuselage, a large ball of orange flame exploded before my eyes.  The whole left wing peeled off and to me, it seemed like an eternity that the plane stood there as if it were flying.  I knew it could have only been a few micro-seconds but the vision is burned in my memory like a still photograph. Then in a flash the plane flipped over on its back as the right wing was still flying.  It wasa violent motion that skewered the whole axis of flight.  At this point, I hesitate to record what I saw next as it is too bizzare to be believable.  Try to accept my version as the truth.  Believe what you will but I'll tell it exactly as I remember what I saw.\r\n\r\nAs the plane flipped, the force of the action catapulted the waist gunner on the right side out of the gun opening and towards our plane.  The arc of his flight thru the air put him towards our right wing and he fell between where I was standing at my bubble window and our right inboard motor.  He did have a parachute. He wore only a harness with two nipples.  (I also had the same type chest pac parachute harness.  My parachute was on the floor by my feet.  We had been instructed that if for some reason you did not have time to snap the chest pac on the nipples of the harness, then just grab your chute, jump out with it in your hand and snap it on as you fall through the air).\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, this unfortunate waist gunner had no such opportunity to grab his parachute before he was thrown through the window.  As he passed me, at most only a few feet away, he was kicking both feet and grabbing the air with his hands in desperation.  Maybe he thought he could grasp our plane in some way to hold on.  I watched him plummet towards the ground until my attention went to the wreck of the one winged B-24 Liberator falling through the sky.  It was cart wheeling nose over tail over the one wing in a  huge windmill spinning motion.  All of the other nine men were trapped due to centrifugal force in the plane with no hope whatsoever I thought.  Will Lundy  reports the plane was A/C #42-29471X piloted by 2nd Lt. G. H. Sweigart and that three men did survive to become POW's.  My eyes were glued to this action as I watched the wreck tumble end over end forat least 10,000 feet.\r\n\r\nI had lost all track of time or anything else that was going on around me when I heard on my helmet earphones, \"Second fighter coming in\".  I looked up and saw a second aircraft repeating what his leader had done.\r\n\r\nAt this point, my mind goes blank, I cannot remember anything about the second or third fighters as they attacked the formation.  I suspect I was too absorbed in my own thoughts and fears.\r\n\r\nAt some point in time, I again came back to reality as I remember our approach to the City of Berlin.  The flak was intense.  The Nazi defenders had 520 anti-aircraft guns trained in a 20 mile arc on us.  The sky was one huge black cloud of explording metal.  The guns fired in batteries of four or so it seemed to me.  When it was bursting at some altitude other than our own, we had little to fear but as soon as they zeroed in, trouble was at hand.  I never did get over the fright of seeing a flak burst right in front of us, then a second a little closer and a third even closer yet.  With each burst, the plane would almost instantly fly through the black cloud.  One could easily sense the cordite smell.  At this point, you knew the next burst would be directly behind the tail.  \r\n\r\nYou note, I said \"With Gods Help\".  This mission was the first time I can remember praying out loud for God to let me live through the battle.  I asked him to let me survive the day.  I promised I'd do anything he asked of me if only he would spare me.  Here I am forty years later and I must admit I have a bit of a guilty conscience when I think back on my promises.  Like all men, the flesh is weak when the danger is past.  Yet, somehow, I feel I hve been a better person for having experienced these strong emotions.\r\n\r\nMany planes went down, I can especially remember one of our planes sliding off to the side in a rather steep dive.  I heard later it was because they had lost their oxygen supply and had flown low level back to base.  We did survive the flak barrage somehow and headed back to England but our troubles were not over by a long shot.  We turned into a 100 knot headwind.  Our indicated air speed was about 165 mph. and at 25,000 feet and as cold as it was (60 degrees below zero our true air speed was over 200 mph.  However with a headwind, our ground speed was something just over 100 mph. Talk about etrnity, this was it, we had 600 miles to go and it would take hours at the ground speed we were flying.  Our fighter escort had turned back due to fuel consumption.\r\n\r\nMany planes were damaged and just would have made it home under the best of conditions but with the delay caused by this strong head wind, somejust could notmake it.  I don't know how many planes I saw go down that day on the way to target, over the city and on the way home!  I know it was a great many.  I saw some explode, others trailing smoke, others with wings on fire and many many parachutes open as the crews bailed out.  But one sight stands out above all others on the wayhome.  As we crossed the North Sea, I began to see planesditching in the water, it was like watching a motion picture.  I was so detached from the action!   Some of the planes would glide to the most gentle stop and the men would climb onto the wings but others would hit a swell in the water and seem to divenose first in a crumpled heap.  It was obvious that almost no one could survive the shock.  British PT boats were on hand to pick up survivors.\r\n\r\nThis was one of the worst days ever for the Eighth Air Force as we had lost 63 four engine bombers and 13 fighters on this mision to \"Big B\" as we often called Berlin.  When we reached base and landed at 1730 hours (5:30 p.m.) I actually bent over and kissed the ground I wa so pleased to be back.  I had been in the air 8 hours and 15 minutes. This was my third mission, now I knew why we were told that if we flew 25 misions at an average of 4% loss per mission, that we had a 100% chance of being shot down.  (They raised it to 30 missions before Icompleted my tour just to be sure none of us made it and then I volunteered for a 31st against all current wisdom to never volunteer for anything).  I did survive the 31 missions and \"GOD WAS WITH ME!\r\n\r\nAfter my experience of seeing the man come out of the pane without a parachute, I had immediately reached down and snapped on my chest pac even though it was considerably in my way to work at my desk.\r\n\r\nWhen I turned in my parachute after the mission I asked to be issued a back-pac chute.  The orderly behind the desk asked what position I flew.  When I responded that I was a navigator, he said that navigators wore chest pacs. I had news for him and I cannot remember what or how I said it, but he issued me a back-pac without an argument.  Never again did I ever take off without my parachute on my back.  I even would flip up the corners to be sure the nylon was in place as rumor had it that some men had bailed out only to find an army blanket stuffed in the nylon's place. The story had it that some guys found it would influence their girl friends if they gave them some nylon.  I don't know how much truth was in the rumor but you can be sure I was not going to take the chance.\r\n\r\nAccording to the \"Mighty Eight War Diary\" by Roger A Freeman, a day to day operational record of the 8th AF, 679 B-17's and B-24's were dispatched of which 618 were effective.  We dropped 1498 tons of bombs. 63 bombers were MIA, three from the 44th Bomb Group, 2 interned, 432 damaged, 18 men were KIA, 38 WIA and 606 MIA.  (of 814 fighters dispactched, 13 were MIA).\r\n\r\nThis amounts to over 10% of the bomber-fleet, and over 77% ofall the effective bombers lost or damaged on this onemission.  I for one shall never forget that day and like every mission I ever had in combat, I flew it twice.  Once in reality and again that night in my dreams.  I relived in vivid detail every event and emotion that I had experienced.  One of our enlisted men actually \"bailed out\" of his top bunk several times while dreaming.\r\n\r\nADDENDUM TO MISSION #3 TO BERLIN APRIL 29, 1954.\r\n\r\nNew information has come to light concerning this mission.  Will Lundy (without whose support this book could never have been written) wrote in a letter to me dated 1/21/86, Quote \"I spent a couple of evenings lately going back through your missions to see if I could \"borrow\" some of your observations and experiences when we lost other planes.  With this casualty memorial that I am putting together I could use the words of observors tohelp put things into perspective along with the stories of the men who went down with their plane - but survived\".\r\n\r\nI was especially interested in your book about your mission when you saw the string of bombs exploding below one of our planes as well as the one where you saw the German e/a hit a plane next to your in your formation - 29 April 44.  But when I went to my file for my casualty memorial and tried to identify which plane it was, I ran into considerable problems as none of the stories told to me jibbed with your view.  No, I don't doubt for a minute that your story is true, but there is plenty of work to be done to identify that aircract, as it appears not to have been a 44th plane!  But I cannot identify which B-24 it was, but it was not a 44BG plane.  We lost two ships on the 29th - and crews, Glenn Sweigart and Keith Schuyler's - and Hruby ditched off the English coast.  Sweigart ells me that his ship had an engine (#3) lose oil pressure, then the prop ran away.  They lost altitude down to 9500 feet and were barely making it against the strong wind and skidding because of the windmilling prop.  Later, they were jumped by fighters and eventually were shot down.  So he couldn't have been in formation with you.  I think that this ship is the one that you thought was rammed by that FW.  The other plane lost was Keith Schuyler's. The navigator tells me that his ship was badly hit by flak and was unable to keep formation either.  They were jumped by fighters and they dove for cover in clouds at about 5,000 feet.  So this could not have been that plane either.\r\n\r\nHowever, Keith Scuyler in his \"Elusive Horizons\" states, \"A B-24 that had been lagging at seven o'clock drew in close at five o'clock just as a German (e/a) came through.  The fighter smashed headon into the big one right at the nose turret (could have been the left wing?) and both planes explosed in a ball of flame.  Then it was over, just like that. But back through the formations behind us the Germans barreled with reckless abandon. Airplanes were going down in every direction, the cripples staggering out of formation, clinging to life - then blowing up or fluttering down out of sight\".\r\n\r\nSo possibly this plane that moved into the formation was not a 44 BG plane at all. In fact, it couldn't have been or we'd have lost three planes instead of two.  I tried to buy one of Keith's books but he is all sold out\"  End of quote.\r\n\r\nI replied in a letter dated 1/16/86.  Quote:  \"Dear Will, thank you for your very informative letter of 1/21/86.  No one can deny your first hand reports by Glenn Sweigart and Keith Schuyler as they were on board the only two planes of the 44th who were shot down over Germany.  Roger A. Freeman's book \"The mighty Eight War Diary\" also states on page 232 that the 44th only lost two planes that day in addition to one ditched.\r\n\r\nThe first hand evidence you have of men who were aboard these two pllanes, gives me reason to believe that you were correct in saying the plane I saw go down was not a 44th.  What I saw was exactly as I wrote in my diary of that day.  It was only our 3rd mission and we were far back in the formation, where I do not know.  It had never dawned on me to suspect that the plane was not part of our formation.  It was not rammed by the by the German fighter as I saw the wing explode before or at the instant the fighter passed me.  I looked the German pilot in the face as he just missed our wing tip.  He did not touch the Liberator with his plane.  The B-24 wing came off from an explosion in the wing tanks.\r\n\r\nIt's likely that Keith Schuyler and I saw the same thing but at different prospectives and he thought the fighter had hit the B-24.  It appears to me that the plane I saw go down must have been the one he saw pull up at five o'clock.  We were on the right side of the formation, I was so engrossed in watching the fighter come at us, I could have easily missed a B-24 pulling up next to us.  I did not notice the plane at all until I jerked my head to watch the fighter go by, then I saw the wing explode.  I was looking directly at it.\r\n\r\nI know no will believe that a man flew through the air and just missed by bubble window but it is the truth.  I saw it with my own eyes, I'll never forget.\r\n\r\nThank you for this new propective you have put on this episode of my life.\"  End of Quote.\r\n\r\nI'm sure more information will come to light as others read this.  I will pass it along as it does.\r\n\r\nI flew 31 missions from April to October 1944.  Volume two of my four books describe in great detail my experiences while in combat.",

    "bioTripDetails": "My initial assignment to the 67th Bomb Squadron was Co-Pilot on the crew of Lt. Chester \"George\" Phillips who, because he habitually called everyone \"George\" became himself  known as \"George. After stateside training at Grenier Field, NH, the crew deployed their newly named \"Little Beaver\" for England on October 4, 1942.\r\n\r\nI remained on the Phillips crew through the terrible months of February, March and April when the daylight bombing attrition decimated the 44h Bomb Group; especially the 67th Squadron.  Of the original roster of Pilots and Co-Pilots their losses were:  Major Donald W. MacDonald, Squadron Commander and Command Pilot shot down with Captain Art Cullen on the 15 Feb. raid on Dunkirk Harbor to sink the German Radar Ship TOJO; Lts. Rufus Oliphant and Co-Pilot Charles Wilkes, also lost over Dunkirk;  Lt. J. B. Long and Co-Pilot Lt. John McCormick killed in a mid-air collision with a 66th Squadron aircraft on the 16 of Feb. raid on St. Nazaire;  Lts. Clyde Price and Co-Pilot Robert E. Forrest, alongwith Lts. Robert W. Blaine and Co-Pilot Lawrence J. Roetto were simultaneously shot down on the bomb run over Rouen, France on March 8.\r\n\r\nThe \"Little Beaver\" flew on each of these tough missions including the TOJO raid.  By the 8th of March 1943 raid on Rouen, the 67th had lost five of its original nine crews.  By the 22nd of March the 67th was down to three aircraft and crews, \"Suzy Q\". \"Little Beaver\"and the new \"Annie Oakley\" (Lt. Williams A. Roach, Jr. has just arrived with his new airplane).\r\n\r\nCalling on experienced co-pilots to bolster the force, I quickly soloed in the \"Beaver\".  With an American transfer from the RAF, Lt. Bill Dabney as Co-Pilot, a new crew was formed and assigned a newly arrived aircraft, which was promptly named \"Buzzin Bear\" (as I was a product of UC Berkley, The Golden Bears).\r\n\r\nAs a small way of celebrating the formation of the new crew, we were granted a three day pass. We went to London.  Upon returning to the base in the early morning hours of 14 May, we learned that the Group was preparing for a mision launch against the Krupp Submarine Works in Kiel, Germany.  It was a maximum effort mission but the 67th could muster only three crews. \"Suzy Q\" was being repaired, so the third crew to be piloted by Lt. Robert I Brown, Major Moore's Co-Pilot, on his first mission as Pilot, was forced to fly a replacement aircraft named \"Miss Delores\".  This aircraft had, to this point, a dubious record for completing missions.  The other aircraft and crews were, of course, Lt. Roach in \"Annie Oakley\" and \"George\" Phillips and Co-Pilot Lt. Everett W. Wilborn, Jr.   For the first mission the crew was to fly without my being in the right seat.  ALL THREE CREWS WERE LOST. Robert I Brown and Co-Pilot Harley A. Westbrook and five others bailed out and were captured.  Three Gunners in the waist and tail went down with the plane.  Hit directly by heavy flak right after target, Lts. Roach and Co-Pilot plus six of the crew were KIA, the Navigator and Bombadier successfully bailed out and were captured.  \"Little Beaver\" was hit directly under the flight deck at the same time as \"Annie Oakley\".  Phillips and Wilborn, along with five other crew were KIA, four others successfully bailed out and were captured. OF THE ORIGINAL 67TH PILOTS, NOW THERE WAS ONE!\r\n\r\nNewly promoted to lst Lieutenant, I flew my first mission as Pilot on April 4 in \"Little Beaver\" on a diversion mission along the Dutch Coast.  My second crew mission was over Brest, Germany in the new aircraft \"Buzzin Bear\".  Ed Mikoloski was my Navigator on this 16 May raid.  On May 17 and again on May 29, we flew missions to Bordeaux and La Pallice, France. All three missions were without losses and the post-Kiel mission morale took a sudden rise.  During June, the 44th flew low level practice missions over England and prepared for the Africa deployment on June 26.\r\n\r\nBetween \"warm-up\" raids against Italian targets of July 2,5,10 and 15 I flew low level training missions in preparation for Ploesti.  On June 17, we took \"Buzzin Bear\" to Naples.  Instead of the usual light defenses of the Italian targets, this day we encountered fierce fighter opposition comprised of both Italian and German E/A.  The \"Buzzin Bear\" crew wrote a page in history when during some thirty minutes of constant attack, they destroyed three Macci 202's, one ME 109 and one ME 110 all officially confirmed and no crew injuries.\r\n\r\nFor the first time the \"Buzzin Bear\" had damage on the #3 engine from a probably 20 mm hit that caused a loss of oil pressure and I was forced to feather #3.  At this point we began to drop behind the formation.  In addition to the #3 shutdown, we had high cylinder head temperatures from the high power settings attemptin to stay in formation. The high power settings with rich mixture in attempts to keep the engine cool, had depleted the fuel reserve.  Additionally, two generators were lost  All things considered, the decision was made to attempt to reach Malta rather than return to Benghazi.  Sometime after setting course for Malta, they saw land ahead and while Navigator Clifford argued it was too early to have reached Malta, the fuel situation dictated a landing as soon as possible.  A long shining strip was sighted on the land which they could identify as a landing strip.  As we turned toward it, one engine quit.  Flight Engineer Gibby quickly transferred fuel and got it restarted.   I also restarted #3 engine and proceeded with a straight in approach and landing.  Prior to that time, the crew had donned their Mae Wests and parachutes and stood by to bail out if things got quiet.  A safe landing was made and rolling to a stop, we were met by a British Officer in a jeep who informed us that we had landed, not on Maltaa, but Comiso Airfield on Sicily, just a few miles from the front lines.  He advised us to remove our aircraft as soon as possible, it was a big target!\r\n\r\nWe loaded 500 gallons of fuel by hand from British 5 Imperial Gallon, Jerry cans most of the day and into the twilight.  After landing DeVinney, Clifford and myself were fortified by two pieces of stale toast and a cup of tea in the Officers Mess, we attempted to sleep in chairs.  The location of the other crew members remains a mystery.\r\n\r\nWe accomplished the return to Benine Main, I was nearly starving when I caught up with Major Moore.  His greeting was \"Where in the Hell have you been\"?\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon of that same day, I was instructed to attend mission briefing for a very important target.  In the briefing I learned I was to lead the Group in \"Suzy Q\" against transportation targets in Rome.  Half of Moore's crew had dysentery and \"Buzzin Bear\" was undergoing four engine changes by the ground crew and half of the flight crew.  Defenses were light and the mission uneventful except this was my 26th mission.  Ploesti\r\nwould be my 27th.\r\n\r\nAfter the Rome raid, we started practice bombing and flying in larger formations of aircraft at low, very low, altitude.  I had actually completed my combat tour of duty with the Rome raid, and I didn't believe that Howard (Moore)  or Colonel Leon Johnson really expected me to fly the upcoming mission.  I don't know why I did either.  However, it was \"high adventure\" and although I didn't know what the destination would be, I hated to miss out on it.  Furthermore, the crew of the \"Buzzin Bear\" didn't want to go with a new pilot.  As and additional incentive, I was thoroughly enjoying the low-level flying.  So I went.\r\n\r\nThe only other individual that I am aware of who had also completed his tour (there were probably others) and volunteered to go was Captain  Roland B. \"Sam\" Houston, one of our best people and an old friend.  Sam was killed with crew while following Jim Posey's formation over Target Blue Five.  He bombed successfully, but went down during assembly for the return.  Sam's gunner also shot down the German Fighter as they were crashing.\r\n\r\nI was flying the slot directly behind Colonel Johnson in \"Suzy Q\", and was the designated deputy leader should \"Suzy Q\" go down.  Notwithstanding that his target had already been mistakenly struck by another flight, Colonel Johnson took his formation through fire and smoke, attacking fighters and withering fire from an unexpected Flak Train to deliver their bombs on target, then turned to fight their way homeward until the enemy, out of fuel and ammunition, gave up the pursuit.  Two aircraft returned to Benina Main non-stop with four engines running, \"Suzy Q\" and \"Buzzin Bear\".\r\n\r\nTwo weeks after the Ploesti raid Howard Moore, having completd his combat tour, turned the command of the 67th Bomb Squad over to me.  I had just been promoted to Major.  I began making preparations for the return of the Group to England when we were ordered to mount a raid on the airfield at Foggia, Italy.  Some new crews had arrived and I scheduled seven aircraft.  There was Jim Hill and Charlie Henderson, the veterans; three new pilots and crews, my crew with two new pilots, Lt. Leighton C. Smith and Flt Officer Joseph S. Milliner (he had flown Ploesti with Henderson) in \"Buzzin Bear\" and a veteran crew from the 506th, Walter Bunker with Dick Butler, who had transferred to the 67th, as Co-Pilot.  Lt. Walter R. Bateman and crew, on their first combat mission were in \"Suzy Q\", and the new crew of Lt. Carl S Hager were in their new plane \"Black Sheep\".\r\n\r\nBecause of their experience, I scheduled the former 506th crew to lead the 67th.  Previous missions to targets in this area, as well as the one I had flown to Foggia, had been made without loss and not much opposition.  So on August 16, I proudly watched them take off-the first mission of the Squadron under their new Commander.  It was a heady feeling!\r\n\r\nThe first hint of trouble came when the veteran lead crew returned early with engine trouble.  Later, when it was all over, only Hill returned!  Our men had run into an estimated seventy-five to a hundred German fighters which had been recently moved down to Italy.  Our Squadron lost five of the seven planes and crews, including my own\"Bear\" and the \"Suzy Q\".  From that day on, I never sent a crew out on a mission that was not absolutely required, or a crew that I did not consider tried and ready for combat.\r\n\r\nI signed on for another tour, took the Squadron back to England, then the return to Africa and back to England.  I relinquished command of the 67th when promoted to Lt. Col. and replaced Bill Strong as Group Operations.  I remained in this capacity with the exception of a stint as Vice Group Commander until the end of the war.  In my post-combat service, I flew nine more combat missions as Command Pilot without mishap.",

I was an engineer from 6-14-42 to 9-12-42.   The task was to make possible for aircraft from the United States to navigate by jumping from Canada to Greenland to Iceland, hence down to UK.\r\n\r\nWhile operating in Greenland, flying with Bucky Warne as pilot, we searched for downed B-17's and P-38's on the Grenland Ice Cap.  We were credited with locating them and dropping supplies.  We were called back to the 44th because of urgency for the 44th Group to leave for the UK.  We assembled, however, in Manchester, NH hence to Gander, Newfoundland.  Col. Robinson was Group Commander.\r\n\r\nYou grow old very fast losing so many dear friends, mainly Bucky Warne (AC 404090)",

On our first mission to the Bielefed Viaduct the instructor nose gunner toggled the bombs accidentally through the bomb bay doors.  We returned to the base with the doors flapping in the wind.\r\n\r\nOn the April 16, 1945 mission to Landshut, Germany, the bomb load was 5000 pounds of incendaries.  The top cluster in the right front bomb bay hung up because it was not loaded properly.  As the armorer, the pilot gave me implicit instructions to get rid of \"that sucker\".  He dropped to less than 10,000 feet over the North Sea.  With the bomb bay doors open I proceeded to cut the two cables that had been placed over the top of the bomb shackle instead of in the release hooks using a pair of side cutter pliers.  As I made the final cut the cluster caught on my parachute harness and nearly took me with it.  Thanks to Jones, our engineer, who grabbed my arm, I was spared a cold watery death in the North Sea.\r\n\r\nOn the April 4, 1945 mission near Hamburg I got a shot at an ME262 jet using the new K-8 sight in the top turret.  He was probably out of range when I fired, although the tracers looked good.",

Norman Nutt at Tonopah in Nov. 44; we were sent to Hamilton Field by train; issued \"sun tans\" processed shots etc. presumably for the Pacific Theater.  32 crews waited assignment -ours was No. 17.  Crews 1-16 flew off in new B-24's.  We turned in our clothing; were re-issued \"winter wear\".  We boarded a troop train for a 4-5 days trip to Camp Miles Standish.  We departed Boston Dec 8th aboard SS Washingon without a convoy.  Arrived Liverpool and subsequently Norwich and Shipdham.",
    "bioTripDetails": "My memories are most indelible - that I survived the war and that I was fortunate to be part of a good, dependable crew.\r\n\r\nOn Feb. 25, 1945 our target was Aschaffenburg.  After our bomb run we were running low on gas, Lt. Nutt \"put down\" at a P-51 base at Chievres, Belgium where we were re-fuelded and took off.  We ran into thick soup; G-Box, Instruments, flight controls were frozen, air speed indicator showed 80 mph.  Lt. Nutt turned back to Chievres but could not locate the field in dusk; he alerted us to bail out and as he was putting on the auto-pilot and heading for the North Sea at which point we caught a glimpse of the field on the horizon where we landed and spent the next 2 days closed in.\r\n\r\nOn March 19, 1945 our target was Neuburg, our pilot was Lt. Norman Nutt.  The #4 supercharger was\"frozen\", #1 & #3 smoking, #3 was leaking gas.  After the target Lt. Nutt headed for nearest point in American lines;  Could not maintain altitude.  A P-47 spotted us and lead us to a steel-mat fighter strip at Luneville, France where we landed safely.\r\nThere I inquired of a mobile Signal Corps Company as to the whereabouts of a 239th Signal Battalion and learned that it was in Nancy about 20 miles away.  That was my brother's outfit.  I hadn't seen him for 3 years.  The GIs called his CO who allowed me to speak to him and to permit him to visit me the following day while our shipwas being repaired and before we took off for Shipdham on a STEEL-MAT runway!\r\n\r\nApril 8, 1945 our target was Bayreuth.  Just after take-off I suffered severe gas pains.  I could not stand the pain any more so at 20,000 ft. and 30 below, I had to relieve in a flak helmet ON the bomb run in the waist with doors open while cracking ice in my oxygen mask.  After dressing and standing a moment another siege befell me but this time the bomb bays were closed.  Opened them and declared \"Flak Helmet Away\".\r\n\r\nOnce, on a 3 day pass to London being of Czech descent and fluent in its language, I decided to visit the Czech Embassy and TRY to speak to its' President-in-Exile, Edward Benes whom I had the pleasure of meeting at a Gymnastic Exhibition during the New York Worlds Fair in 1939.  On my entering the Embassy his Military Guards saluted me (a S/Sgt) as if I were a Dignitary General.  He did grant me an audience during which time we reminisced about Czech Culture, traditions, cuisine, where my parents were born etc.  and before my departing he consented to sign my \"short-snorter\".",

Eight minutes before IP 6 of our 9 500 G.P. pounders fell through closed bomb bay doors leaving them fluttering loosely in slip-stream and creating a terrific drag and demand on gas supply, but our pilot kept up with the Formation 'sweating out' the situation.  On nearing base he headed straight for runway at which time engines began sputtering.  Our right gear went down and locked but not the left one when the engines 'conked out'.  Our Pilot handled belly landing skillfully to minimize damage to P+.  The waist section was filled with long sparks, smoke, melted aluminum debris, etc.  The crew evacuated safely; subsequent dip-stick in tanks indicated NO trace of gas.",

Clarence J. Ducote and Gunners Sgo Hugh J. Malone and Sgt. James R. Young.",
    "bioTripDetails": "My first combat mission on 12-12-42 was as a fill-in for a mission to Abbeville Airdome, the home of Goerings best fighter squadrons.  Major Kay was leading the squadron and allowed me to fill-in in the event any 66th aircraft aborted prior to entering the French Coast.  None aborted and I returned as ordered.  It was Major Key's squadron policy the the Squadron C.O. and Ops Officer (which was my duty at the time) should not fly on the same mission.  In this instance Major Key allowed me to do this as a practice mission for me and my crew.  \r\n\r\nOther memories include the loss of 2nd Lt. Herb Frawley and crew in May 1942; my Co-pilot 2nd Lt. Dale K. Canfield on a January 3, 1943 mission;  my best man at my wedding at Will Rogers Field, OK Captain Howard F. Adams on a 2-26-43 mission; and later Bill McCoy and crew on a practice mission.  Next to our Squadron Commander Algen E. Key, Bill was the most popular and admired Pilot in the 66th Squadron.  These losses have left me with sad memories\r\n\r\nMost of my missions while on submarine patrol in the US and overseas can best be described by \"Hours and hours of pure boredome inter-disbursed with moments of stark terror.\"  On one patrol I noticed what I thought was a fog forming just beneath my flight level.  Moments later I glanced at my altimeter which was reading an altitude of only 20 feet.  What was earlier thought was fog forming was actually the surface of the water.  I had been flying on auto-pilot and gradually descending from normal patrol altitude.  Appropriate action was taken.  Overseas combat was much the same when enemy fighters were the only escort the B-24 had for most of my combat tours in 1943 and 1944.\r\n\r\nOn early missions the B-24 Formations were to small to defend against enemy fighters.  The B-24 was physically hard to fly in formation.  When ordered to stack up instead of down in formation left wing pilots had to fly in co-pilot seat.  After the Kiel mission B-24's and B-17's were never flown together.\r\n\r\nMy assigned aircraft and crew was reassigned to Pilot Hilliard who crash landed on January 3, 1943 in South Wales when 2 engines on the same side failed.  The Co-Pilot, Dale K. Canfield, was killed when his seat malfunctioned and failed to prevent his being slung forward.\r\n\r\nBecause I never had to abort a mission, I was known as a lucky pilot.  Pilots of the 66th Squadron asked me to fly with them on their last manditory tour mission, which I did and we always completed the mission.",

New bikes were impossible to get.  It was my most treasured gift.\r\n\r\nAfter the war, he found much success in the insurance business.  He was highly respected and admired.

Sometime later in my tour, our Ground Crew Chief presented me with a chunk of flak from #3 engine, otherwise, my combat career was as uneventful as combat can be.\r\n\r\nI flew 30 combat missions. The last was on 05/01/1944.\r\n\r\nThe worst part of a mission, aside from the 0300 wake-up, was the period between pre-flight and start-engines time.  That interim gave one time to think.  The moment we belted in and began the check list, ALL SYSTEMS WERE GO!\r\n\r\nI believe that what enables a soldier to continue fighting is the belief that he will return whether or not stated, this conviction is essential.\r\n\r\nSix years before I retired from USAF, I met Elizabeth D. Fields, an Air Force Nurse at Westover AFB, MA where we were stationed.  We eventually married.  I later learned that she had been stationed in the mid-1950's at the 44th Tac Hospital, Lake Charles AFB, LA.\r\nElizabeth retired in 1973 as a Lt. Colonel.  (We may be the only 44th couple).",

I cut the straps of the ammunition boxes attached to the catwalk and kicked them out.  They had chutes on them.  While positioned on the catwalk, I saw ground rifle fire, coming from the German troops hiding in the brush.  Two days later we learned that the German troops got most of the supplies and ammunition that was dropped.\r\n\r\nThe German's used to send \"Buzz Bombs\" over our base on the way to Norwich.  The air raid sirens would always sound, for fear one would hit our base. we would always jump out of our bunks and run into the air raid shelter located a short distance from out hut.  Of course, this would always happen during the night when we were asleep.  One time and the last time, I ran into the shelter there was about a foot of water in the shelter floor (barefoot).  I thought if I was going to get killed by a Buzz Bomb, at least it would be in bed.\r\n\r\nI recall my mother sending me a box of goodies, that contained 3 Postum cans, that I believed contained Postum.  I never opened them, as I never liked Postum.  I gave them to the lady who did my laundry.  Some time later she thanked for the cans of mixed nuts. My mother went to her grave without me ever telling her about it, because she knew I liked mixed nuts.",

I flew 2 more voluntary missions while I was in the wing, one being on \"D-Day\".\r\n\r\nMy worst mission to fly was Ploesti and the \"D-Day\" mission was my most historical.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the \"Wing\" I served as Operations Officer for some time.  Upon leaving the \"Wing\", I returned to the USA and was assigned as C.O. of the 206th Base Unit in Alomogordo, NM.  I replaced Col. Grady Tibbets as C.O. and was introduced to the B-29.  I was with the 206th for several months until HQ decided that no more tests were needed on the various airplances being tested and the unit was split-up.  I was then sent to the Air Forces \"Board\" in Florida.  I finished my duty on the Board serving in various assignments until I was released.\r\n\r\nOne of my main regrets about my serive is that I do not have a copy of the \"TIPS\" for new B-24 crews coming to England that General Johnson asked me to draw up as the Assistant Operations Officer for the of the newly formed 14th CBW.  I worked hard on it, and it was well received.  General Hodges wrote up a Commendation to me for it.  Many new crewmen received many good tips from experienced crews and I intended to keep a copy of the \"TIPS\" but didn't. I keep hoping that I will run into someone who has a copy that I can borrow for awhile to make a copy for myself.",

    "bioArrivedHow": "Our ship left Boston Harbor on April 27, 1942 and joined a convoy that zigged and zagged its way across the Atlantic so that the German Submarines would have a more difficult time aiming their torpedoes at us.  Two weeks later we disembarked at Prestwick, Scotland and I was transferred to the \"FLYING SCOTSMAN\". A fast train that took me to the 8th AF Headquarters Squadron stationed at Bushy Park near London.",
    "bioTripDetails": "Among my personal memories, I remember German planes blitzing and dive bombing London.  Whenever I was in London on a pass and the bombs were landing to close for comfort, I would head for a bomb shelter or go down in the train subway.  But sometimes, I would just stay up and watch the search lights pin point the German Bombers so the flak guns could concentrate their fire power on them.\r\n\r\nOne day a notice appeared on the bulletin board that volunteers with radio experience were needed to go to a radio and gunnery school to learn English radio procedures and how to fire a machine gun in combat.  The plan was that as radio operators trained in English radio procedure we would be flown back as a group to USA.  Then each of us would board a lead plane in a formation of bombers flying back to England.  As English trained radio operators we would have the know-how and equipment to guide our Bomber formation on a radio beam to an English Airfield.  To make a long story short, by the time our radio and gunnery course was over, every Tom, Dick and Harry was flying his own Bomber across the Atlalntic and they didn't need our services anymore.  Now that we had graduated from radio and gunnery school, John Cole, Adolph Brzozowy, Oscar Kriesig, Goodman, Don Bowie and I volunteered for combat duty and were assigned to Hardwick, a B-25 and B-26 base.\r\n\r\nOur next assignment was to Shipdham Airfield near Norwich.  Shipdam was Headquarters for the 68th Squadron of the 44th BG and we would be flying our combat missions on the B-24 Liberator Bomber.  Since none of us had trained with a crew in the States we had to volunteer to go on a mission whenever a radio operator or gunner on a crew was sick.  I volunteered for every mission because I wanted to get my 25 missions completed so I could return to the USA.\r\n\r\nI flew 10 missions over Germany, Holland, Belgium and France.  My most memorable missions were to Kiel, Germany; Ploesti, Rumania and Foggia, Italy where my plane was set on fire and I parachuted out.\r\n\r\nOn May 14, 1943 I flew to Kiel, Germany on a plane name \"MARGARET ANN\".  As our bomber formation approached the Kiel target we were faced with the worst barrage of flak that I had ever seen.  When an explosion went off underneath us and our plane lifted and shuddered, I knew we had been hit.  With the bomb bay doors closed and the bomb run completed our formation made the turn back to England.  The fighter planes were waiting for us and as we exchanged fire with them our plane was hit two more times.  One burst tore a big hole in one of the tails and the other hit the right wheel and put a hole in the wing.  Two of our engines stopped so our Pilot George Jansen feathered the two propellers.  We were losing air speed and falling behind the Group.  So George Jansen put the plane in a steep glide and we headed for the safety of flying just above the tree tops.  Since we had four wounded men on board and two feathered propellers we were given priority to land.  We landed on only one wheel and when the opposite wing touched the ground we pinwheeled to a stop around the wing tip.\r\n\r\nAll 12 blades of the propellers on our B-24 were hit at least once.  There were 300 major holes and inch or more in diameter and more than 2,000 minor holes in the plane.  When the wheel was hit it left a large hole in the right wing.  There was a hole in one tail so big that you could step through it.  Several Generals came up to Shipdham to see the plane.  Pictures were taken and sent to Washington and it was designated as the \"Most shot-up plane in the European Theater, up to that date\".  For this mission to Kiel, Germany the 44th Bomb Group earned the Distinguished Unit Citation.\r\n\r\n\"PLOESTI MISSION\"  To bomb and destroy the oil refineries at Ploesti, Rumania was the \"BIG SECRET MISSION\" for which we had come to North Africa.  An extra gas tank was installed in the bomb bay so that we could complete a 2,700 mile round trip.  As it turned out, of the 178 aircraft that took part, 90 did not return to home base.  Of the 1,725 men who took part, 872 did not return.  In sacrificing their young lives these men helped shorten the war and saved thousands of lives in the long run.  Of the 88 planes that returned, only 30 were in flying condition so they could take off the next day if they had to.  Thanks to my Pilots Eunice Shannon and Robert Lehnhausen we made it safely back to Benghazi, North Africa.\r\n\r\nOn August 16, 1943, my aircraft the Natchez Belle was shot down over Foggia, Italy.  Pilot Eunice Shannon, Navigator George Temple, Bombardier Elwood Collins, Engineer Dennis Slattery, Radio Operator Clarence Strandberg, Waist Gunner Clarence Rothrock and Tail Gunner Robert Vogel became Prisoners of War. Co-Pilot George Hersh, Waist Gunner Clayton Heller and Well Gunner Nick Smith were killed in action.\r\n\r\nI have many good memories of living and visiting with my buddies in the Barracks and Mess halls.  Memories of going to London on pass with John Cole and Adolph Brzozowy and many other good friends.  Seeing Madam Tussard's Museum in London.  Flying over the English countryside and practicing low level bombing runs for the upcoming Ploesti Mission.  Parachuting out of a burning plane and being captured.  Escaping from POW camp and living, eating and sleeping in the Italian Mountains with Phillip Teraberry and Mike Seigel for seven weeks.  Coming home to the states and kissing the ground.  Going home on furlough and seeing my parents, brothers and friends after being away for 3 years.  And the Best Memory of all, missing a train connection in Chicago and meeting my future wife, Dorothy when I went over to North Park College to visit old time friends.",

I had to apply power and run off the side of the runway, I ended up stuck in the mud.  The landing aircraft hit the spot where I had been waiting.\r\n\r\nI completed a total of 30 missions.  I flew 16 leads although records only show 12 leads.  I flew 4 other leads with the 491 BG and the 389 BG.  Had lead crew checkout as PFF and \"G\" Bombing systems.  Had several lead drops with 98% in 1,000 ft. circle.\r\n\r\nMy first mission was 6 Nov. 44 to Sterkrade, Germany.  We had flak holes in the fuselage.\r\nWe carried 4-2000# bombs.\r\n\r\nOn the mission 6 Nov. 44 we sustained aircraft damage.  We had a runaway prop on \r\nthe #4 engine, it was a pre-dawn instrument take-off and skidded off the edge of an icey runway.  Had to beat the Co-Pilot's hand holding throttle to reduce power.  We were able to stop aircraft.  Used a stand-by to complete mission.\r\n\r\nOn the 9 Dec 44 mission our back-up aircraft received damage to #3 engine, while returning another engine started running rough.  We salvoed our bombs over the channel.\r\n\r\nOn the 24 Dec. 44 mission to Ruwer, Dalfzel and Eller Railyards and Tunnels the 44th put up 61 aircraft, 16 aircraft from the 67th Sqdn.  Flew K which held the 44th record of 68 missions with an abort.\r\n\r\nOn 28 Dec. 44 the mission was to Kaiser Slautern.  We received flak damage to the #2 engine and had to feather it.  The engine had to be replaced.  The nose turret plexiglas was broken, and a hole about 3 inches in diameter made the nose turret a little drafty.\r\n\r\nOn 6 Feb. 45 flew first lead to Madgeburg.\r\n\r\nOn 1 March 45 the mission was to Ingolstadt Marshalling Yards.  It was a 9 hour 10 minute mission.\r\n\r\nOn 2 March 45 mission was to Madgeburg the hydraulic system in tail turret by knocked out by flak.\r\n\r\nOn 14 March 45 lead the 491st Sqdn. on a mission to Gutersloh Marshalling yards.  Had 80% in 1,000 foot circle.  Best in the wing.\r\n\r\n11 April 45 bombed Newmarket it was #30 and my last mission.",

When the left landing gear hit a crater, it swung so hard his seat let loose and propelled him into the controls, severly bruising his right side.  But since he \"could still walk, he could fly\" so he completed his 35 missions.  \r\n\r\nNine months later they discovered he had injured his right kidney in that hard landing.

    "bioTripDetails": "I was only 19 yrs. old through-out my wartime experiences.  The highlights follow:\r\n\r\nl.  The bonding of our 10 main crew.  We knew and trusted each other like brothers.  The four of us still alive remain like brothers.\r\n\r\n2.  The fantastic and exciting flight from Topeka, KS. to England. For a kid less than l year out of high school, seeing Trinidad, South American Jungles, the Amazon River, the walled-city in Dakar, the Sahara Desert, Morocco and finally landing at Valley, Wales (a ten day adventure).\r\n\r\n3.  The bravery and heroic actions of my fellow crew members.\r\n\r\n4.  We flew 32 missions in the 70 days we were operational (5/21/44 to 8/1/44.  Average time for a mission was 6 1/2 hours. Total combat time 205 hrs. 45 min.\r\n\r\n5.  Our crew #2355 credited with 6 enemy planes and 3 probables.  Thanks to our top turret and nose gunners Sgts. Branson and Bushby respectively.\r\n\r\n6.  We considered Lt. Conrad Menzel one of the finest pilots in the 8th Air Force.  Unfortunately he died 3/14/93.  Truly one of the greatest and most esteemed men I have ever had the good fortune to know.  It was his flying skill that brought us back safely.    \r\n\r\nSpecific Mission Comments:\r\n\r\nOn 6/644 our mission was the D-Day Invasion Coast, our load 12-500# bombs, we did not have flak or fighters, and the result was unobserved, flying time 5 1/2 hrs.\r\n\r\n6/21/44 our mission was Berlin, Germany, the load 10-500# bombs, the flak was heavy and accurate.  We had to turn back with feathered engine between Berlin and Hamburg and bombed Willoshaven, Germany all by ourselves.  Our hydraulics out, we landed at Shipdham with crew in tail to keep nose wheel from collapsing, time 8 hrs.\r\n\r\n6/23/44 our mission Laon, France, load 52-100# bombs and the target the airfield.  The flak was heavy and accurate, no fighters.  We made 2 passes before bombs away.  There were 78 holes in our aircraft, my waist window and top of fuselage blown out by flak, time 6 hrs.\r\n\r\n7/7/44 target was Aircraft engine plant at Bernburg, Germany, load was 12-500# bombs.  The flak was heavy and accurage and we had ME410's and ME109's .  Our results were very good.  Sgt. Busby shot down ME410 and 1 probable.  Our Pilot, Lt. Menze flew cover for a P-38 that was flying alone on 1 engine.  Menzel had the P-38 pilot fly under our wing and escorted him back to safety, time 8 hrs.\r\n\r\n7/11 and 7/12 both missions to Munich, Germany, our load 6-1000# bombs (delayed fuse) and 6-500# bombs, our target the city and airfield.  The flak was heavy and accurate and the time was 8 1/2 hrs.  It was exhausting physically.  Pills kept us alert.\r\n\r\n725/44 our target the frontlines in France .  Our load was 52-100# bombs.  The flak was light and no fighters.  Time was 5 hrs,  We were to bomb in front of a smoke screen.  Unfortunately, the wind changed and the smoke was blown toward the American troops.  Some 380 US Infantry troops were killed our wounded.  General Lesley McNair was among those killed. (WAR IS HELL).",

The flak was heavy and accurate.  After bombs away were were attacked by yellow-nosed ME109's (Sgt. Branson shot down 2 of the attackers)*  Number 2 engine was hit by 20 milimeter cannon.  Prop controls, hydraulics, oxygen all shot out.  Our navigator, Lt. Bennet, was wounded and our flying speed was down to minimum to sustain flight at 500 ft. we started to jettison all loose equipment into the North Sea.  We were consistently loosing altitude.  We finally reach England and Shipdham without flaps or nose gear.  It was one pass-no possibility of a go-around.  It was a staright-on approach by Lt. Conrad Menzel (pilot) with no flaps or nose gear plus no brakes displayed GREAT COURAGE, SKILL AND COOLNESS in making the landing (lt. Menzel should have received no less than the Silver Star.  The ship did not blow.  It was sent to a repair depot and the catwalk spar repaired by chaining a telephone pole to it.  Ship returned to service and appropriately named the \"FLYING LOG\".  The restored ship crashed again at Shipdham in August 1944 minutes after take-off on a mission with a full bomb load killing entire crew and completely destroying the \"FLYING LOG\".

Traveled by train to Cheddington, England.  12 Nov. 44 assigned to AAF Station 120 temporarily for training along with 9 other B-24 Crews.  All crews were reassigned 4 Dec 43 to 44th Bomb Group.",
    "bioTripDetails": "We arrived at Prestwick just at sundown and before we could unload our belongings total darkness had settled.  This was a darkness none of us had ever experienced.  We were immediatley placed on a train heading south, to where, we knew not.  We arrived at APO 634 (Cheddington) Combat Crew Replacement Center in the wee hours of the morning.  Later this day our Navigator, Lt. George W. Blumenthaler was killed.  He was riding a bicycle and pulled in front of a GI Truck,  apparently unaccustomed to driving on the left side of the road.  The crew attended his internment ceremony at the American Cemetary at Cambridge.  \r\n\r\nAll members of Lt. Rose's crew finished 30 combat mission in May 1944, except George Belsky, a waist gunner.  He was killed on his last mission which was piloted by Lt. Bonnet and was forced to ditch in the English Channel.\r\n\r\nSpecial Mission Commennts:\r\n\r\nThe mission was to Frankfurth/Main, Germany the site of a piston ring factory.  It was attacked by only a portion of the planes from the 44th.  Bad weather caused the failure.  A target of opportunity could not be located to be bombed, so many of the aircraft came back with their bomb load;  ten had bombed the briefed target with unobserved results.  Some accurate flak was encountered near the target area and several aircraft landed away from base due to the damage sustained.  One aircraft pilotedby Lt. Robert E. Rose, crash-landed with four dead engines, caused by a failure of the fuel transfer system.  The crash was not marred by any injuries and the aircraft was in repairable condition.\r\n\r\nI was the co-pilot on the aircraft piloted by Lt. Rose and we were on our 11th mission.  Shortly after passing the French Coast on our way home, the No. 4 engine suddenly quit, causing us to fall out of the group formation.  After switching to crossfeed we finally got the engine operating, but over England, and too risky to dump the bomb load.  So we headed for Shipdham maintaining 7,000 ft. just under the existing cloud layer.  Approximately 30 minutes later all four engines quit.  Three airfields were in sight that could be used for an emergency landing.  Just about a 1,000 feet from the end of the runway a B-17 taxies onto the runway on which we were lined up.  Our only alternative was to land on the grassy infield.  Just as we touched down on the grassy infield the B-17 broke ground on its takeoff some 20 feet between wingtips.  Even though the brakes were locked, there was little, if any, braking action.  We hit a hedgerow on the airfield boundary, then a rock fence which folded the left landing gear and brought the aircraft to a stop.  All crewmembers immediately abandoned the aircraft safely.  Since all of the fuel had been used or lost the likelyhood of fire was diminished.  To my knowledge no bomber aircraft ever successfully made an emergency landing with 4 dead engines and a load of bombs.  This occurred at Thorpes Abbott, England the home of the Bloody Hundreth B-17 Bomb Group.\r\n\r\nLt. General \"Jimmy\" Doolittle assumed command of the 8th AF near the lst of January 1944.  Considerable changes were made in the operating procedures immediately.  Some of which would affect the combat crews were:  l.  Bombing mision would be permitted to make predawn takeoff.  2.  30 second intervals between each aircraft taking off.  3.  Maintain radio silence.\r\n\r\nEach aircraft was permitted to have his HF radio tuned to the tower frequency.  However, with radio silence, there was no method to verify that the HF radio was set on the control tower fequency.  Always there were at least two aircraft lined up behind the take-off aircraft ready to go at their 30 second interval.\r\n\r\nSuch was the case of the aircraft in front of me.  He had added full throttles which indicated to me it would be a normal take-off being made, but such was not the circumstance.  He decided to abort his take off, but no word was forthcoming on either our HF or VHF radios.\r\n\r\nOur crew procedures on blackout takeoffs were to have the pilot lower his seat, then perform a pure instrument take-off.  The co-pilot would keep and outside view of the runway and the dimmed runway lights.  The engineer would be located immediately behind the pilot and co-pilot to continuously call our airspeed until the \"gear-up\" command was given.  In this instance, the engineer had just called out one hundred when the cockpit was lit up by a red light from the control tower. I immediately looked down the runway and sure enough, there was a B-24 right in the middle of the runway!  The blue lights on the horizontal stabilizer were so close that there was not time to do anything other than to haul back on the control wheel.\r\n\r\nAlthough there was no indication that we had made contact, there sure was some doubt in my mind.  Our aircraft reacted immediately and was airborne instantly so obviously we were above flying speed.  We went on to complete the mission without and further incidence.  Upon our return, and immediately after the engines had stopped, our engineering officer was quickly examining each propeller blade for nicks or any other damage.  I saw him, poked my head out the cockpit window and told him, \"We saw the aircraft on the runway and was sure we missed it.\"\r\n\r\nIn the final analysis the third aircraft behind us nicked the horizontal stabilizer of that aborting aircraft on the runway.  The tower made no further effort to warn any other aircraft that were behind us.\r\n\r\nThere were other incidents during my 30 misions that other than the Grace of God could we have survived.",

It was primarily a ship building and fitting-out port and and the mission was to disrupt the work going on, especially in the submarine shelters.  The 44th BG was assigned the destruction of the torpedo stores, this would seriously curtail the activities of the U-boats.\r\n\r\nThirteen ships took off from the Shipdham base, four from the 68th aquadron. Plane #806 took off with the rest of the group and proceeded to target without incident, where the bombs were dropped.  The 68th planes were on the tail end of the Fortress formation and due to miscalculation of the leading navigator on the Fortress planes, deviation from the ordered route resulted.  Planes turned in close to Havolford, West Wales, as fuel pressure dropped.  The Engineer S/Sgt Hyllan Simmons checked the gas gauges and reported 45 minutes of flying left, so he suggest #806 head for a landing immediately.  Lt. Roy Erwin found a field in the distance and headed for it.  As soon as the ship was pointed at the field, #1 and #2 engines cut out.  In the meantime Lt. Erwin held the heavy side up, and the plane was going along all right on two engines.  Then #3 went out and the heavy side dropped, the plane went into a nose dive from about 600 feet.  T/Sgt Laskowski woke up in a hospital with two broken arms, a concussion, lacerations, contusions and loss of two wisdom teeth from the opposite sides of his mouth.  Lt. Erwin was badly injured and died two days later.  Lt. Clark Swanson, the co-pilot was killed instantly.  Sgt. Lanville McCarty, was thrown out of the top turret received a broken arm, brain concussion and lacerations on his face.  Lt. Thomas Deavenport died in the hospital five days later, never having regained consciousness.  Lt. John Gavin, with severe injuries was in the hospital for four months and finally went back to the states.  S/Sgt Hylan Simmons, in the bomb bay when the plane crashed, received a broken ankle.  He was trapped and rescuers had to dig him out.  Sgt. Robert Teasoner, tail gunner, was knocked out of his GI shoes (although the laces were still tied);  He was badly shaken up and had a bone chip in one of his heels.  Sgt. Delbert Perry was also badly shaken up.",

We went by train to Cheddington, Eng. arriving there on Sept. 12th to set up a temporary base.  On Oct. 12th we broke camp for Shipdham Field in Norwich, Eng., where we were stationed for the duration of the war.",
    "bioTripDetails": "I was drafted into the Infantry on March 1, 1941and assigned to the 101st Infantry, K Company stationed at Camp Edwards (now Otis AF Base) only five miles from my home in Falmouth.\r\n\r\nOn June lst, 1942, I was promoted to Corporal and put in charge of a Platoon.\r\n\r\nThings were looking bad in Europe, many of us decided to sign up for the Air Force for 3 years.  On Sept. l, 1941, I was shipped to Jefferson Barracks, MO. One month later I was sent to Kessler Field, Biloxi, Miss. to Airplane Mechanics School.  After graduating in May, I was sent to Barksdale Field, LA where I joined the 44th BG, 68th Sqdn for the duration.  I was made Staff Sgt. and Crew Chief in August 1942.  There were no more openings for Tech. or Master Sgts. so I stayed a Staff for the duration of the war.\r\n\r\nAt Barksdale Field, our Sqdn.(B24's) was assigned to hunt German Subs.  The 68th was credited with destroying a German Sub about 120 Miles south of Mobile, AL. in the Gulf of Mexico.  I believe the date was July 20, 1942.\r\n\r\nI left the 68th Sqdn. in Oct. 1942 to join the 506th Sqdn. (also stationed at Shipdham) because my Commanding Officer told me that a new Sqdn. of B24's was coming in from the \r\nStates \"with no mechanics\" and I could make Master Sgt. like the other Crew Chiefs.  They came over with \"CREW CHIEFS ONLY\". Took me two months to get back to the 68th.\r\n\r\nMy time served in the Infantry and with the 8th AF during WWII was a tremendous experience that I will never forget, but I would not want to go through it again.\r\n\r\nI married my wife of 52 l/2 years in March 1946.  She was from Leeds, Eng.  I flew to England to get married, when she became ill and could not come over in February.  We were married March 14, 1946.",

    "bioTripDetails": "Mr. Cudd is deceased and the date is unknown, but we do have some wonderful records of his personal recollections.\r\n\r\nAsk Tex Burgess if he remembers us bringing I-Bar #193 back from near Kiel, Germany on 6 July.  We were in a steep left bank about 20 miles SW of Kiel, turning onto the bomb run at the IP \"Woody\" Wilson, our Radio Operator, was standing on the catwalk opening the bomb bay doors when we took an awful blast off our right wing.  This lifted us up and over to the left and at the same time a piece of shrapnel went into the wiring and salvoed our bombs.  We went up through the flight formation, but did not go over on our back.\r\n\r\nWhen we got settled down we were all alone, so we started a turn  back to England when a P-47 came up on us and said that he was out of ammo and his engine (R2800) was running hot.  It should have been, too, as the bottom 3 \"jugs\" and lower cowling had been hit by something very large.\r\n\r\nHe pulled up under us and said that he would try to stay with us.  Almost at that same time two FW190's came at us, so he (P-47) took out after them like he was loaded for a bear and they disappeared.\r\n\r\nWe had already notified Air-Sea Rescue, so when our \"Little Friend\" said, \"Well, there she goes\" and that big 4-bladed paddle just came to a stop.  The pilot put that P-47 into the channel right beside a crashboat.  He stepped out on the wing and then into the boat.  We don't believe that he even got his feet wet.\r\n\r\nWe continued on back to Shipdham and landed OK.  As we were on the runway, one of the other B-24's made his 30th mission pass and dragged their little short antenna off the bottom of the catwalk.  We got back to our hardstand and parked our \"wreck\".  After the Engineering Officer made his inspection of it, he said that \"there was no way we could have flown this ship back\".\r\n\r\nThe left wing was hanging down so low that I could have changed the Navigation light while standing on the ground under it.  It was about five feet above hardstand.  Also, we had 127 holes in the left outer wing panel larger than your fist on up to larger than your head.  Holes smaller than your fist numbered up into the hundreds or more.\r\n\r\nIf Woody had been at his station on the flight deck he most likely would have been killed or seriously injured.  Holes were everywhere.\r\n\r\nTex and his helpers found a green painted wing for replacement that matched the damaged one, so they got the job done in a few days.  We looked rather odd with a dark green wing on one side of a silver plane.  The enemy singled us out and wanted to take a shot at us.  To say the least, our other crews tried to avoid us and stay at a distance.   Eventually, paint remover was used to remove the green paint and make us look \"normal\" again.\r\n\r\nOn another mission, I was watching a squadron of 12 Libs flying above and back of us and a bit to our right.  They were making an awful lot of contrails when three German twin-engine fighters came out of the vapor screen behind this formation, fish-tailed as they flew through the formation and knocked all or most of them out of the sky.\r\n\r\nI called Jack Booth, our tail gunner, to open up on them BEFORE they got into our range and keep firing because we were not going to take those gun barrels home anyway.\r\n\r\nWe were both firing when the lead plane started firing at us.  I could see the shells coming at us and I thought, \"Well, I am dead!\"  But again, the Good Lord was looking out for us as that old B-24 settled down out from under the line of fire, and it  passed over the top of my plexiglass dome.  SO CLOSE!\r\n\r\nThe lead German plane pitched over and went down in a dive, and out of my sight.  Jack said it went down.  The other two aircraft broke away without further firing.\r\n\r\nAfter completing my 35 missions, I liked to fly our \"Cowboy\" ship used to lead the planes forming up for missions.  If I remember correctly it had wide yellow and dark stripes (Lemon Drop).   It flew many such flights with only one pilot and a flight engineer.\r\n\r\nI remember one time when I was firing off Green Two Star shells to help the planes find us and make formation.  When we had the 44th BG on its way, we were going back to the field when the pilot said, \"You fly this thing, I want to go back to the waist to take some photos!\r\n\r\nSo, here I am, all alone on the flight deck of that B-24!!  What a day for a 19 year old!\r\n\r\nI went on to get my wings, and then flew for 28 years--loved every minute of it.",

    "bioTripDetails": "My first mission on 8/24/44 was to bomb an airfield at Scherin, Germany.  We were near the target area when we lost all electrical systems and 3 turbos.  We had to leave formation and return alone.  80 miles of enemy territory then 800 miles across the North Sea.  Used straight dead reckoning navigation--thank you Pan American instruction.  Made it back to base. Received minor flak damage.\r\n\r\nOn 10/1944 we flew a low level supply mission.  Our part of \"Market Garden\" airborne invation.  Lots of small arms fire.  We could hear bullets zing-zing as they hit our plane.  Over Hertogenbosch at building top level we could see Dutch people waving and cheering on their side of the street and German Machine Gunners on the other side.  Our Radio Operator was on the catwalk to kick out bundles of 75mm howitzer shells.  Just before drop, a 20 mm shell hit the bundle. Charles Daughtry kicked it out as one shell blew up just below our sirplane.  No vital damage but many small holes in our B-24.\r\n\r\nOn 10/25/44 our mission was the oil refinery in the Ruhr Valley.  We had heavy accurate flak for 32 minutes.  The Hydraulics were shot out.  Lead Pilot Parks hit in the Chest.  His navigator Whitsitt hit in back and knocked unconscious for a while.  After this mission my co-pilot Hugh Maxwell wasn't sure that he would ever want to go duck hunting again.  No one hit but 42 holes in our plane.\r\n\r\nOn 3/24/45 we flew a low level supply mission to Wesel, Rhine River crossing.  War was very much in evidence, dense smoke from wrecked planes and burning buildings.  Our group lost two planes only 2 survivors.  A total of 22 bombers were lost out of approximately 84 on this mission.  It was a rough combat mission.  It was Pilot Bob Seever's last mission and my next to last.\r\n\r\nI have fond memories of sailing a small rented sailboat on the East Anglia Broads with my Bombardier Bill Zoellmer.  A welcome break from combat.\r\n\r\nSpent three days in Brussels, Belgium soon after it was liberated.  Landed there due to engine problems combing back from 10/44 mission to Gaggenau, Germany.\r\n\r\nSunday dinner with a British family in Great Yarmouth, England.  Felt that our war effort on their behalf was appreciated.",

    "bioArrivedHow": "We flew from Kansas to Grenier Field, NH to Goose Bay Labrador, where the snow banks were higher than our wings.  We left Goose Bay at night during a blinding snow storm.  Our pilot took the plane up to 12 thousand feet before we broke out of it.  I didn't know the trouble we were in until our pilot John Milliken came to visit me after the war was over.  He told me that we were dead that he had lost all of the instruments and he didn't know where we were and didn't know where we were going.  Our Engineer, Marty Richards, got them working again by switching the vacuum to another engine. Our Navigator, Jack Bertoli, who was about 20 yrs old hit Iceland, that looked like a postage stamp from the air.  We stayed overnight and headed for Ireland.  In Ireland we left the B-24 and they flew us to England to join the 44th BG.",
    "bioTripDetails": "There are too many incidents to mention all of them, but four of them still haunt me.\r\n\r\nThe first incident was when we were over the channel heading to our targert.  A B-24 came down through some clouds and hit another plane.  I watched both these aircraft go down until they hit the water.\r\n\r\nThe second incident was on the way to bomb Politz synthetic oil refinery.  German planes passed over us and hit the 492nd bomb group that was behind us.  I watched every plane go down.  They were wiped out by the German fighters.\r\n\r\nThe third incident was to bomb Munich.  We were told at the briefing that it was clear over the continent but as soon as we got over France the clouds were up to 20 thousand feet.  We took our plane up to 25 thousand before we broke into the clear there wan't two planes together.  We joined some other planes from different outfits and continued our bomb run.\r\n\r\nThe fourth incident is one that I will never forget.  We had a stand down for that day (Aug14, 1944) but they decided to send us on a milk run.  The German army was in retreat so they called for air support to try and slow them down.  We were flying deputy lead and it was to be our last mission, our tour of duty was to be over.  Thats what we thought!!!!\r\n\r\nWe got a direct hit by German flak over Falaise at 1:30 in the afternoon.  The entire left wing was on fire and we were going down.  The Pilot gave the order to bail out which we did from 18 thousand feet.  Our plane the Passion Pit, named after a lounge in Tucson, AZ where we took our combat training blew up after we got out.  I landed in the middle of the German troops and was captured.  There are many things that happened before I was interned at Stalag Luft 4 for 10 months of which the last three months was spent on a forced march in the coldest winter in history.  We had evacuated the camp because the Russians were coming.  We were ill shod and had very little clothing.  They made us sleep on the cold wet ground or in barns.  The lack of food was bad.  We walked 600 miles with very little food and no sanitary provisions.  Most men were infested with lice and had dysentary.  About 1500 men had died on this march across Germany. We were liberated by the English in May of 1945.",

(Lands End) and Bungay (Base 125, Home of 446th BG.",
    "bioTripDetails": "I was Navigator on Jim Wylie's lead crew with the 446th later becoming known as the Bungay Buckaroos.  This crew was later selected as radar and GH crew and assigned to the 93rd BG, Shipdham.  When the crew finished its tour of 30 missions in late June 1944, I was assigned to the 44th BG, 68 BS as instructor navigator in radar and GH Bombing.\r\n\r\nI flew three additional missions with the 44th, including the March 24, 1945 low level mission to Wessel, Germany in support of the paratroopers as BG lead Navigator.\r\n\r\nI was lead Navigator on 29 of my 33 mission.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of June 44, we were on a bombing mission over Rheims, France.  The group was hit by fighters either l09's of 110's.  In the skirmish that followed one of our Waist Gunners was badly wounded.  He was given immediate attention, a tourniquet was applied to stop the bleeding and a shot of morphine to quiet him down.  We left the formation with American P-51's accompanying us across the Channel to an RAF base where he received more first aid before being sent to an American Field Hospital to operate and repair the damage to his leg, ankle and foot. He eventually recovered but not before many more operations. He led a useful life but ended up crippled.  I was able by chance while meeting a friend of mine from Indiana to locate him after 44 1/2 years and renew our aquaintenship.\r\n\r\nMy most memorable experience was flying on the initial D-Day mission.  It was awesome seeing all the water craft from Battleships to Landing Craft, to Carriers in the water beneath us.  Thousands of ships of all sizes and hundreds of thousands of soldiers, sailors, marines and airmen on their way to defeat the Third Reich into submission.  Little did I realize that our crew was one integral part of the entire operation.  We dropped our bombs at 06:08 1/2 on 6/6/44 on Omaha Beach, then turned back to base too pick up another load of bombs to drop at Normandie.\r\n\r\nWe had a great crew both air and ground.  They were proud of what they were doing and put their heart and souls and energy into repairing the flak damage we often had and kept the Princess O'Rourke and Werewolf in the air until it was crash-landed by another crew.",

    "bioTripDetails": "Specific Mission Comments:\r\n\r\nThere was one mission, my 17th with the 68th Squadron, that I'm sure those who flew it will recollect.  It was one of the worst they ever had. I was the co-pilot on Torrell's crew.  At this point, I would like to say that he was the nicest, friendliest, most cooperative pilot to fly with.  Our working relationship left me feeling that I was as much the first pilot as he.\r\n\r\nWe began the mission assigned right wing on the high element.  After forming over the North Sea, the deputy lead indicated mechanical problems and aborted the mission.  We were considered to be first fill-in for aborted aircraft so we moved into the deputy lead position.  Everything was routine until just before the IP.  When the lead ship called us and asked if we would take the lead because their autopilot was malfunctioning, my throat mike wasn't working properly.  I said we weren't prepared.  Lead ship responded, \"Fine, we'll form on you\".  I called the bombardier and told him we had to bomb.  He responded, \"I can't bomb, I slept through the briefing. I don't know where the target is\".  Feeling the pressure of the emergency with flak going crazy around us.  I told the bombardier either he drops or I will come back and do it for him.  His response, \"I'll drop your (expletive deleted) bombs\".  He then picked the biggest warehouse on the river and blew it to you know what.  The problem was it was three miles past the target.  In that extra minute, the 88's were able to zero in and a number of planes in the formation were hit including ours.  We had a burst directly beneath us that blew a hole in our No. 4 oil tank, attempts at feathering were unsuccessful causing the engine to freeze with the blades flat.  The burst also cut the main electrical cable to the one and two engine with props set at 2100.  We had lost control of the propellers and all instrumentation on the left side of the airplane.  When we stabilized the airplane and found ourselves still flying we proceeded on the return track toward England.  There was the usual crew discussion on what the best plan was.  The crew didn't feel we could make England and wanted to try to get to Sweden.  When I was consulted, I asked the crew if they were prepared to fight off the German Luftwaffe by ourselves.  I said our best plan is to follow the path of the bomber stream where our escort fighters would be looking for strays.  Part way along the return route, a lone P51 came over to look us over, inspected our damaged aircraft and flew on our wing for about a half hour.  Then he signaled low fuel and left.  Over the Zuider Zee four aircraft approached us head on at about 2,000 yards.  They flipped into a verticle bank and we could see the twim booms of the P38's.  A most welcome sight.  I could have kissed them.\r\n\r\nWe still had the North Sea to cross, which we did, giving up altitude to reduce fuel consumtion.  We crossed over the English Coast at about 10,000 feet where the British shot at us.  Approaching Shipdam, we called the tower and advised them that we had battle damage, hydraulics gone and that we could make one pass at the field.  The tower advised Roger when on downwind fire yellow-yellow flares so we can pick you out, which we did.  It was a hazy day.  We followed the ship in front of us and the entire stream had been overshooting the approach and had to S back to line up.  When it came our turn, the B24 behind us cut us off on the final approach.  I called him by number and requested he go around.  The tower picked up my call and advised him to go around.  The tower blinked a red aldis light in his face.  The officer on duty at the end of the runway for emergencies like this shot red-red flares in his path.  The aircraft continued on to land.  Torrell called on the intercom and stated that we have to go around and started to apply the throttle.  I grabbed his hand and pulled the throttle to off and told him we can't go around, we don't have the power with our flaps down, gear down and two engines at 2100 RPM.  If we are going to crash, let's do it here where there are ambulances and fire equipment.  Torrell proceeded to make a great landing right on the tail of the other B24 about 100 yards back.  We were travelling 140 miles per hour.  The plane ahead of us was going 120 MPH and slowing.  As soon as our wheels were on the ground, we applied the left brake, then the right brake and passed the offending airplane on the grass with our brakes locked on.\r\n\r\nI recently found that this landing was filmed when it occurred and I was able to see this on a VCR tape entitled \"B24's at War, Series 2 with General Johnson narrating. The airplane I flew on June 29th was \"Smokey Blue P-Peter.  The aircraft on the tape was a 68th Squadron plane with a tail marking of P-Peter.  That was our last mission with the 68th Squadron.  The following day Major Bob Lenhausen came to our Nissen hut to tell us that the 66th Sqd had requested a \"Lead Crew\"  and since we had flown one lead we fit the qualifications and would be transferred.  The remaining missions were flown as radar lead, bombing only Germany and only when cloud cover was ten tenths.\r\n\r\nAfter having flown 17 missions with the 68th Sqd and 13 missions with the 66th Sqd. making a total of 30 combat missions with the 44th Bomb Group, I was then assigned to the 2nd Air Division Weather and Relay Flight.  In this assignment I flew 35 additional operational missions.  My duties, as weather scout were to visually check the weather in the area that was anticipated to be in the target area when the bombers arrived.  I also was required to fly a specially-equipped B24 to provide Airborne Radio Relay to the 2nd Air Division fighters when these fighters were on a deep penetration escort beyond reliable radio range of the 8th Air Force Control. (Colgate)  When radar in England detected enemy fighters rising to attack the approaching bombers they would vector the 2nd Air Division fighter escort to intercept.   Dec. 19, 1944 when the German attack began in the Battle of the Bulge, I flew a weather Recon Mission which required a take-off when visibility was less than 10 ft. (no typo)  A Jeep was needed to lead my plane to the end of the runway.  At 500 ft. we broke out on top.  We reported clear weather for as far as we could see.  After about an hour, we requested landing instructions and were told to stand by, which we did for over 8 hours.  I make plans for the crew to bail out while there was enough fuel to set the autopilot to carry the plane out over the Atlantic.  At the last moment, we were informed that an RAF Fighter Base south of London was opening up.  (Bigger Hill)  We found the field to be 9/10th overcast.  We would find a hole, spiral down through it and take a heading toward the base.  When the clouds came down to meet the ground, we frantically climbed as steeply as possible to back on top and look for another hole.  This process was repeated several times until one of the crew spotted the field.  We entered the pattern very tightly and started our final approach and found that the sun was directly in our eyes.  Everything was white.  We did manage ot pick out some small building just before the end of runway.  After going around and again on the final we dropped our gear and flaps and went through very low until we spotted the aforementioned building.  We cut the power.  I was mighty glad to walk away from that one.",

Sometime in 1943, I visited him at 8th AF Headquarters in High Wyckam, near London.  He provided me with several Hebrew Prayer Books, 2 minature Torahs and I returned to Shipdham and started having Friday night services.  Each week attendance was fantastic.  Not having experience in delivering sermons and being very friendly with the Protestant Chaplin, Wesley Cain, we played handball frequently on Shipdhams Squash Courts. I asked Wes if he would deliver a sermon for us on Fridays and he was absolutely great.  Wonder if anyone can track down Wesley Cain.  I'm sure he was from New Orleans.\r\n\r\nIn my mind General Johnson was the greatest.  He came to the Finance Office for his pay one month.  I had a sign on the door--\"closed for Lunch - 12 - 1\".  He said to his driver, \"We'll come back later.\"  Luckily I was nearby and said no way--opened the door and paid the General.",

    "bioArrivedHow": "Near the end of June Harper and his crew were sent to Lincoln, Nebraska with the Crowder Provisional Group, 12th Heavy Bomb Sqd. to pick up a new B-24D at the plant there. Harper and his crew left Lincoln Ne. along with the Crowder Provisional Group of 40 planes and flew over to England via Bangor, Me. and Newfoundland, leaving Bangor, Me. on about July 6. It was raining and there was a good wind when they arrived in England. They had a very good navigator who lead them right to their correct base in England which was not easy since bases were 1 and 2 miles apart in that area. They may have had 2 more weeks of gunnery training and then were sent to North Africa via Morocco and with a stay over possibly in Tunis before arriving in Benghazi, Libya.  Flew the North Atlantic route in new B-24 from Bangor, to Newfoundland, to England where new B-24 was left.  Sent by train to Shipdham, Norfolk.  With the air echelon already in Africa, the Currelli crew made their way to join them.  Arrived at Benina Main, Benghazi, Libya just prior to the low level Ploesti mission of 1 August 1943.",
    "bioTripDetails": "The personal experiences  and memories are submitted by Buster Zoller's nephew Bob Zoller. \r\n\r\nHe was a member of the 44th Bomb Group, 66th BS.  Shortly before Aug. 3, 1943 his crew moved to Benina Main in Bengazi, Libya in North Africa.  He described the weather as very hot and the water bad.  They were at Benina Main on Aug. l, 1943 at the time of the Ploesti, Roumania Oil Field Mission but were apparently without a plane and therefore did not take part.  After the Ploesti mission they helped to search for missing crews from the mission.\r\n\r\nDuring the morning of August 1, 1943, day of the Ploesti mission, there was another crew, Pilot Tom Scriven's crew, who was preparing to take their ship \"Lady Luck\" #41-23778 F in the air.  They encountered mechanical problems or overfueling on \"Lady Luck\".  They switched to another plane, \"Scrappy II\".  Unfortunately \"Scrappy II\"  was lost and all were killed at the target over Ploesti.  This left \"Lady Luck\" without a crew and this is how Lt. Curelli and his crew (Buster's crew) were assigned to the \"Lady Luck\".  This plane was once named \"Jenny\" and was first piloted by another crew and had quite a history.  Walter Patrick and Harold Samuelian were one time crew members of this B-24 and told me its story.  They had already completed over 25 missions before the Ploesti mission and therefore did not take part in this mission.  This aircraft was one of the lst B-24's sent to England by the 44th BG in Sept. 1942.  The plane's first mission was to Abbeyville, France on Dec. 12, 1942.  It was on the first mission into Germany to Wilhelmshaven, the German U Boat base on Jan 27, 1943.  On this mission the plane barely made it home after being badly shot up (Approx. 200 holes in it!) and having hydraulic problems. As pilot Jim Kahl was transferred and Tom Scriven became pilot the crew renamed the aircraft to \"Lady Luck\", a name which came from a London (Barksdale Field) restaurant napkin given to Walter Hazelton, (a crew member) by his girlfriend.\r\n\r\nBuster's assignment was as a gunner on board his B-24.  Their lst mission was a very long one from N. Africa to Wiener Neustadt, Austria on Aug. 13, 1943.  Their second mission was to bomb the airdrome at Foggia, Italy on August 16, 1943.  This was the very day the American forces were crossing over to the toe of Italy from Sicily.  Previous flights were \"milk runs\" but on this day, the Germans had been moving forces around and they met the American bombers with everything they could put into the air.  A total  of 25 bombers left Benina Main at 0430 reached the target at 1033 and were attacked by large numbers of Me109's, Ju88's and Fock Wolf 190's.  7 to 8 or about a third of the planes were shot down including some of the most famous planes from the Ploesti Oil Field mission only two weeks before.  Buster's (Harper's) plane was lost near Routi, Italy.\r\n\r\nThe following account was made by Wesley Zimmerman, the only survivor:\r\n\"Contrary to the MACR report, I do not recall our ship being hit by flak.  After passing over the target and dropping our bombs, one of the engines went out due to an extreme oil leak.  When this #3 engine failed and we fell out of formation, that is when we were hit by enemy fighters.  After several direct hits from the fighters, we tried to get out of the plane, but could not.  The main hydraulic system would not operate, we couldn't get the bomb bay doors open in order to jump.  At this point, Sgt. Grinde, engineer, went out the sliding door to the bomb bay without a parachute on, to try to open the bomb bay doors manually.  This was the time when the ship went into a dive or spin and the sliding door came down and we could not get out.  Since I was on the flight deck I don't know if any of the crew in the rear got out before the plane exploded.  But when it did explode- which I think was caused by the fire in the burning engine reaching the gas tanks. I was somehow blown clear, and opened by chute and came down safely. I had several small cuts on my head and arms and was black and blue over most of my body for two or three weeks.  I was taken prisoner by the Italians and was in several camps before escaping and returning to Africa and later back to England and the States.  Also contrary to the reports, I saw only one other chute and that landed several hundred yards from where I did.  I went to it and it was Lt. Curelli.  He was badly torn up and dead.\r\n\r\nThe crew was first buried in Routi, Italy then later moved in 1944 to a military cemetery in Bari, Italy.  The parents of Buster moved him to his final resting place at White Chapel Cemetery in Troy, Michigan.",

We embarked as soon as we reached New Jersey.  From the train we went to the ship and up the gang plank as the last man reached the deck they raised the gang plank .  We were underway.  The ship was crowded so we slept where ever we found a space.  I think we were assigned 10 decks below the water line.  No one cared.  Glen Miller's Band was on the ship and they played for us.  If I remember it took four days to cross the ocean.  The mess hall was the swimming pool.  We got two meals a day.",
    "bioTripDetails": "Personal stories are plentiful but one that stays in my mind occurred when we were on a long mission.  Some of the crew started talking about how hungry they were.  We always had a case of K Rations on board and this gave the waist gunner an idea.  Why not open the box and pass it out to the crew.  No one objected so we all had K rations.  On our return to the field the crew chief wanted to know what happened to the K Rations.  We didn't talk, but they made our pilot pay for them.  We got the riot act and that was the last time we ate K Rations.\r\n\r\nAnother time at night a buzz bomb was coming over, the air raid sounded everyone ran out of the hut to the shelter.  To get there you either had to jump a ditch or go around, so I knew that I coldn't make it.  That night I did.  The next two days, I tried each day to jump the ditch, each time I fell in.  I couldn't get across.  It shows if scared enough what can happen.\r\n\r\nSpecial Items to Remember:\r\n\r\nMission  #25-Nov. 6, 1944.  The 44th bombed a target at Sterkrade, Germany.  The 32 ships that the group dispatched formed the 14th Combat Wing and were the third Wing in the Division.  The Target was an Oil Refinery.  The target was covered with 10/10 clouds with unobserved results.  The 506th A/C 44-40071, ), Sweat Box crashed on landing.  The 506th sent eight ships to Sterkrade.  We were on instrument flying for 1 hr. and 15 min.  our bomb load was 4-2000# GPS bombs.  Fused wire was pulled and we dropped three bombs on target the fourth bomb would not release.  That meant a 2000# bomb was stuck in the bomb bay.  There was no way we could get back to England with this bomb aboard and the amount of fuel we had.  I transferred fuel from one tank to the other, it was decided we couldn't fly on two or three engines to conserve fuel with this load.  So I put on a portable oxygen bottle and walked on the cat walk in the bomb  bay.  This walk is about 6 inches wide.  I looked down and all I could see was clouds and some ground when the clouds broke.  It was frightening but I knew I had to do what I was trained to do.  I manually tripped the bomb release, it would not release, my oxygen was running low and in frustration I kicked the bomb.  It released and fell someplace in France.  I had on heavy flight boots so I didn't feel the kick.  I flew as a Flight Engineer, my position was on the flight deck between the pilot and co-pilot. On taking off I would be lookout in the top escape hatch telling the pilot what was around us front, back and side, and start the auxiliary power supply.  Pre flight the plane before take off.  I was senior non-com and part of my job was to check on the enlisted crew.  I kept the log book for the flight.  On take off and landings I would call out air speed, I watched all the instruments, engaging our auto horizon to make sure it would not fall off and give incorrect readings.  Fuel consumption was my job.  I watched the manifold pressure to get the most out of fuel use, watch RPM of engines. On take off back up Pilot and Co-Pilot holding controls so they wouldn't slip down.\r\n\r\nMission #27-November 10, 1944.  There were 21 ships from the 44th leading the 14th Combat Wing on a raid on the airfield at Hanau, Germany.  Results were throught to be excellent, flak was moderate and accurate in the Koblenz area.  Fighter support was excellent.  We were the fourth Wing in the Division.  Bombing was on GH through 10/10 cloud cover.  This means we were above the clouds and the sun was shining.  I asked the top turret gunner Chuck Walsh to let me sit in the turret so I could get some sun.  He said, OK we were out of the flak xone and fighters.  He put his flak vest on me and his flak helmet.  There I was in the turret swinging the guns around and having a good time in the sunshine.  At this time we were in a flak field, black puffs were all around, the waist gunners were being pelted, luckily no one was hit.  A burst came on top of the plane taking the plexiglass turret off.  I was sitting between two 50 Cal machine guns. A piece of shrapnel hit one of the guns, bounced off and hit my flak helmet.  It went through the flak helmet and into the rubber ear cup on the flight helmet.  I was knocked out for a moment for the impact.  When Chuck dropped the seat on the turret, and I fell to the flight deck he throught I was dead.  When I came to, and I saw what had happened I couldn't believe I came out of this alive.  When I finished my missions the Captain gave me permission to take the helmet home with me.  The flak has been removed from the helmet to be used by one of my children for show and tell at his school.  You can still see the hole in the ear cup where the flak penetrated.  All I can say God was with me.",

When I married my wife of over 53 years in 1947 and we had our first child June of '49, we decided to go into busines for ourselves.  The Automotive After Market was my field, so on October 1, 1950 our first enterprise was born.  Over a period of 31 years it grew to be a large factor in the automotive world.  Occupying 55,000 sq. ft. of warehouse space, we serviced most of the South; mass merchandisers, and oil field industries.  The corporation (then Sun Distributing Co.,Inc.) was sold to the parent company -GKN of England.  The next two years, I exercised other skills.  Then I moved to Baton Rouge, LA to become their Federation Executive Director.  After returning to New Orleans full time in 1985, I plunged into community service-sitting on boards of both non-profit and religious organizations.  My most recent job placed me on the pre-planning commission of the city of New Orleans as on going job evolving various city projects.  At 79+, I am very active - play golf as often as I can, an avid computer person, and spent time enjoying my remarkable grandchildren, as well as the families of my two boys Alan and Larry.",

    "bioTripDetails": "I arrived late at my duty station due to an emergency leave because of my brother's death.  Since all of the crew assignments were taken, I had to go overseas to England with ground support personnel.  I was therefore assigned to be responsible for various unassigned enlisted personnel.  After receiving inoculations and preparing legal documents, I was transported to the docks for boarding and got my first view of New York harbor and the huge liner, Queen Mary.  After about six days of zig-zag course changing across the ocean, we entered the Firth of Clyde on the Scottish shore.  We finally docked and found several trains waiting to carry us to our operating base at Shipdham, near Norwich, in the lowlands of southeast England.  With freshly constructed runways, we found mud everywhere.\r\n\r\nAfter a few familiarization flights around England, we initiated short bombing missions against French coastal (German occupied) airfields and submarine installations.  We were escorted by British and Polish flown Spitfires.  The RAF soon got tired of being shot at by both the US gunners and the Germans since the Spitfire 5 and the Messersmit looked a lot alike, especially from the front.  The Germans quickly learned that a frontal attack was the most effective, and safest for them.\r\n\r\nOn one of the early missions, James O'Brien's crew lost both their navigator and bombardier.  Msgt. Crisan took the bombardier's slot and John the navigator's post.  After several missions to the sub pens at Brest, ST. Nazier, France, and airfields on the coast and at Paris, we hit the sub facilities at Wilhelmshaven, Germany.  As it was a very important sub base, it was heavily defended.  Several planes were lost, mainly due to enemy fighters as we had no excort for that mission.",

We had to zig-zag to avoid overrunning the 17's (B-24s were faster)  and overflew the island of Helgoland, a German flak school.  Our plane took a hit in the bombay and fighters knocked our tail gunner out of his position.  We staggered over the target alone and dropped our bombs, turned off the target and bailed out.  The survivors were taken prisoner by the German ground forces.  We lost our pilot, \"Mac\" Howell and a waist gunner.\r\n     We were taken to a prisoner of war interrogation center at Frankfurt for two weeks; then to the main camp, Sagan, close to the Polish border where we remained except for four months at Stalag VII-A near Moosberg.",

It wobbled around, so I only used it when flak was visible.\r\n\r\nI was on a bombing run going into Brunswick, Germany, when we were suddenly surrounded by flak.  I reached down at my side to secure my helmet which felt different.  It had a hole in it!  I dropped it and never put it on again.  After landing, we found the piece of flak that had made the hole.  The piece of flak and the helmet are now on display in the Rapid City, South Dakota, Museum.\r\n\r\nTwo of the planes we flew were named \"Lil Cookie\" and \"Glory Bee\".\r\n\r\nUpon concluding 30 missions (through D Day) I transferred to the 14th Combat Wing Headquarters.

A 20 mm shell exploded over the navigator's head and a portion of it went through the co-pilot's hand.  He lost the middle finger.  Two of our engines were also hit.  One was feathered and the other windmilled.  We landed at a Spitfire base.  The B-24 flying on our left wing went down and so did the FW 190.  I think I contributed to that, although I believe our waist gunner claimed the credit.  I was manning the ball turret at the time.\r\n\r\nOn the March 6, 1944 mission to Berlin, I was assigned to fly with another crew as a substitute ball turrett gunner.  I tried to test fire the guns without success as they had been installed incorrectly.  I felt useless but I kept the turret moving.  After leaving the target, the radio operator said \"We've had it.  We'll have to bail out.\"  I started out through the bomb bay when I noticed that the bombs were hung up, wedged between the rack and the side of the plane.  I threw my chute back into the waist, and without oxygen, I managed to kick the bombs loose.  I think the rest of the crew thought better of me after that.  I received a DFC after just a couple more missions.\r\n\r\nI finished 30 missions with no more close calls.",

The planes came over the base and peeled off to begin their circle to land in clear weather.  Then the snow storm squalls hit and visability went to zero.  The planes, low on fuel, pulled up and waited for the squall to pass, which it did.  Then two planes approached the runway, but from opposite ends!  One landed okay while the other gunned his engines and passed safely overhead.  Then the base closed again with another snow squall.  After it had passed, two more planes approached the same runway from the same end!  One landed on the runway, but the other had to take to the sod.  After a wide ground loop that plane also came to a safe stop.  Other planes came in intermittenly until all were safely down.",

    "bioTripDetails": "During what I believe was our 24th mission, our flight position was off the right wing of the flight leader in the top flight of the top squadron (the 67th).  I don't recall our target other than it was long.  After leaving the target, we started to let down over France when the weather began to worsen.  We were about 12 to 15,000 feet over the channel and it appeared that all of England was closed in, except for a small area, maybe two square miles.  It seemed that the whole 8th AF was trying to get down through that small space.  We, of course, were the last plane to let down.  At about 5000 feet the weather completely closed in on us, so we headed northwest, hoping for better weather.  We broke out at about 500 feet over the \"Wash\" (a large bay off of East Anglia) with maybe one-fourth mile visibility. We took a heading for Shipdham (our base).  We encountered no other planes, thank God!  We flew over the base as visibility diminished by the minute and established a base leg using the red flares at the beginning of the runway.  On final approach we had difficulty in aligning with the runway due to the fog setting in.  We went around, timing ourselves on each leg.  Again on final approach we failed to align ourselves with the runway as all we could see was the red flares.  While on final this time Collins (our pilot) turned on the \"glide path\" system.  Immediately the vertical line responded and gave us a heading.  At this time fuel was critical!  We found ourselves in perfect alignment and landed just as the red lights came on for all fuel booster pumps.  At debriefing, we asked why we were not advised of the glide path system and were told that none existed at Shipdham.  On further investigation we learned that a B-17 base 15 to 20 miles away had such a system which apparently paralled our own runway.  I definately believe that we had a guardian angel with us that day!",

    "bioArrivedHow": "I flew in a B-24 via New Foundland.",
    "bioTripDetails": "On May 14, 1943, we were one of three B-24 crews in the 67th squadron of the 44th Bomb Group scheduled for a raid on the sub pens at Kiel, Germany. This was the first time both B-17's and B-24's were sent on the same mission.   A unit citation for this mission was later awarded to the 44th.\r\n \r\nSince our original plane, \"Suzy-Q\", was in for repairs, we had to use a replacement, \"Miss Delores\", a plane that had sat in a dispersal for some time.  Our engineer, Gil Wadtck, had indicated that he would not care to take \"Miss Delores\" over a target because he had been jilted by a Delores back in the States and that \"Miss Delores\" probably would take us over the target but not bring us back!  \"Miss Delores\" was contrary.  However, since \"Suzy-Q\" was out of action, the war had to go on.\r\n\r\nWe were briefed early, and took off for a rendezvous with the B-17's over the Wash in East Anglia.  The rendezvous was goofed up.  Instead of flying above and behind the Forts, we missed the rendezvous by about 10 or 15 minutes.  The Fort squadrons were ahead of us, and above the B-24's of the 44th Bomb Group by at least 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nWe tried to overtake the B-17's and get above them but the chase was futile.  We could not catch them even though we were faster.  When we got to the target (Kiel), we had reached a good altitude but the 17's were still ahead of us.  The German gunners had a good track on the B-17's and the 24's coming in on the same track encountered a lot of flak.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Delores\" took a hit and we started to fall behind, as one of our left side engines was out.  \r\n\r\n\"Wing\" had recently declared with a directive that radio operators could not man the top turret, but should man the radio.  Gib Wandtke was operating the top turret on this mission.  But the flak burst had also hit Gib, who had taken metal in his knee.  He came tumbling down out of the turret.  He motioned to me that I should get into the turret, and I did.  But unknown to me was the fact that the flak burst had also knocked out the intercom!  Everyone, therefore, was on his own.\r\n\r\nWhen I got into the top turret we were already a sitting duck as we were falling behind the formation due to that lost engine.  And my guns would not fire between the two verticle stabilers for some reason.  I kept cussing as I would bring the guns down to shoot at least six following Jerries who were taking pot shots at us from the rear.  I don't know if our tail turret guns were functioning or not.  But soon our left wing started on fire - and it was time to get out.\r\n\r\nJust when I decided the situation was too precarious, out pilot, Lt. Brown tried to give the signal to bail out, but he could not communicate with the crew to advise them.  We had dropped our bombs and the bomb bay doors were still open.  Gib Wandtke, wound and all, fought his way back to the rear of the plane to tell the gunners to abandon ship.  When he got back to the flight deck I had found my chest pack chute and was standing on the catwalk at the front of the bomb bay.  So I tumbled out, and knowing that some Jerries would attack a chute, I delayed my opening of the chute for about 60 counts.  When I pulled the cord, my altitude was about 8,000 feet and the feeling was very eerie - no sound whatsoever.  It was a very, very quiet feeling.  The wind through the shrouds that could be called a whisper, was the only sound to be discerned.\r\n\r\nAbove, I could see the remaining planes on their way back from Kiel.  Back over the bay, I could see many chutes on their way down high above me.  Below, I noticed some boats leaving their wake in the bay.  Shortly thereafter, I took off my bail-out bottle, my shoes, and loosened by harness as we had been instructed to do over water.  Hanging onto the harness by my hands, I approached the water of Kiel Bay.  There was one problem however.  How do you know how high you are off the water?  Are the whitecaps you can see six inches high or 16 inches high?  You have no reference point on water to judge your altitude.  When I thought I was six to ten feet above the water I let go of my harness, but I had miscalculated.  Just as I let go, my feet were already in the water and the shroud lines came tumbling down over my head.\r\n\r\nAs I entered the water I went on down possibly ten feet, but being buoyant, popped right up under my shroud lines.  The parachute canopy also had dropped over my head and my fight to free myself began.  I struggled with the shroud lines and the chute until I thought I would never get free.  Just then a boat came by and a fisherman took his gaff and pulled the chute from my head.  Then he gaffed me and pulled me out of the water like a big fish.  He probably saved my life by being there.  Other members of the crew, if they did not delay their opening, may have drowned by being blown out to the mouth of the bay.\r\n\r\nThe first words uttered by the boat crew were \"Fer sie der krieg ist fertig\", meaning \"For you the war is finished\".\r\n\r\nLater I learned that during the battle, Lt. Hayworth, our bombardier, after dropping the bombs, saw a cannon shell coming toward the front of the plane and covered his head with his hands.  The shell exploded on the plexiglass nose section and shattered plexiglass burst against him.  When he became a POW, his hands and forehead were peppered with shrapnel and plexiglass.  He no doubt saved his eyes by shielding them with his hands.\r\n\r\nI did not realize that the last three original planes in our squadron had been hit and downed on this mission until the crew members of the other B-24's showed up in the prison camp.",

There were some 16,000 or 17,000 of us.  She was packed and chow lines were operating continuously around the clock.  We were limited to two meals each day but fruits were placed on our bunks.  We had 3 double bunks in our cabin.  Some had eight bunks, but there were no complaints.",
    "bioTripDetails": "On January 18, 1944, orders from 8th AF Hdq. assigned for 2nd Lt. WAS Women Officers to the four Cambat Bombardment Wings (B-24H) in 2nd Division as Crytographic Security Officers.  Glamorous as it may sound, being the only female military person on the base was unparalleled, uncomfortable and at times a lonely situation.  You didn't have another woman to talk with!  However, we \"gals\" did manage to visit each other when we could \"hop a flight\" to their respective wing station or take leave as we did to London, Scotland and Paris after cessation of European activities.\r\n\r\nThe men who worked in these Code Rooms were well trained and extremely competent.  Those in the 44th Code Room were tops.\r\n\r\nI remember the night when a tap on my window woke me and I was informed that a TOP SECRET message had come in and a vehicle with an armed guard would take me down to the Code Room to handle the message and deliver such to Gen. Johnson.\r\n\r\nI can clearly recall the day we were alerted that some of our code machines and systems had possibly been compromised by the Germans during the Normandy Beach invasions.  This meant \"scrubbing\" those systems and immediately going over to a different procedure.  As it turmed out the position had not been over-run, but we couldn't take any chances.\r\n\r\nI had a chance to go up in a B-24 at Shipdham.  It was quite a project to get me into the heavy insulated leather flight suit.  We needed to find the smallest size available and to add a parachute.  We were not high enough to need an oxygen mask.\r\n\r\nI had a chance to see all the stations-radio, tail gunner, waist gunner and the Norden Bomb site in the nose.\r\n\r\nAnother flight on a B-24 was when we took a crew to Birmingham so they could return to the states.  Coming back we were on instruments all the way.  \"That blew my mind.\"  You couldn't see a thing then our first view was the estate house/manor at the end of the Shipdham runway.  WOW!!\r\n\r\nOn August 25, 1944 the Glenn Miller concert was held in the hangar at 392nd Bomb Group in Wendling.  I feel very fortunate to have a picture taken of me standing on the stage with Glenn Miller.  He had asked me to come forward to draw names in a War Bond promotion.  His band toured many of the 8th AF bases.\r\n\r\nAs time went on with the war effort there was less and less need to use code methods for some of our transmissions and much was put over to PL (Plain Language.)  I was then a 1st Lt. and on Feb. 25, 1945 was appointed A-3 (Watch Officer) 14th CBW and worked in Wing Control Center preparing briefing information for missions and controlling and monitoring mission activities until the cessation of hostilities on May 9, 1945.\r\n\r\nUsually, with completion of the 200th mission, a bomb group would stage a big party/celebration with parades and possible fly overs, etc.  All extra work for many and in particular for the enlisted, ground crew and mechanics\r\n\r\nGeneral Leon W. Johnson felt very strongly that all should enjoy the day off.  He issued \"SPECIAL ORDERS\" commanding all offices to exchange duty with their \"enlisted counterparts\" where ever it was possible and to exchange insignia and carry out the duties of their \"newly\" assigned counterpart.  A complete reveral of roles and duties where ever and when ever possible.\r\n\r\nBeer barrels were located at the various intersections throughout - the base figures say 2000 gals.  Gambling tables were set up in a hangar and the \"famous 44th Combat Bomb Group's Flying Eight-Balls\" had a BALL!\r\n\r\nGeneral Johnson replaced the one star flag on his vehicle with a special flag of three stripes for his driver, Sgt. Fusano and drove him around the base where ever he wished to go.  When Sgt. Johnson drove up to the main gate of the 44th BG with the \"new\" General Fusano in the back seat, the group executive officer carried out the duties of the gate keeper and gave Sgt. Johnson a bad time.\r\n\r\nGeneral Johnson was \"Lynched\" and taken down to the duck pond near one of the squadron mess halls and throuwn in.  Great fun was had by all.  Later in the day Col. John Gibson and I were also \"lynched\" and met the same fate.  A great 200th Party!\r\n\r\nGeneral Johnson was deeply concerned for every single person in his command.  He went out of his way to see that their needs and wishes were met.  He was highly thought of by all who served with him.\r\n\r\nEarly on, his driver Sgt. Fusano was instructed to automatically stop and pick up any member of the base who was walking along the road from squadron sites to the base headquarters, hangars and dispersal area or flight lines.  The base was pretty much spread out over the flat, flat, flat English country side.  An ideal situation where General Johnson could talk with his men and learn about their gripes and problems.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived at the 14th Combat Wing, I was given quarters and assigned to the Wing Club Room and dining area.  There were slightly more than a dozen officers, it was very informal and we had our meals there with General Johnson.  This was the room that had all the \"Wall Art\" that we hear about.  Possibly this building may be repaired as an historical marker.\r\n\r\nI had been there only a few days when General Johnson showed me his Congressional Medal of Honor ribbon and asked if I would please sew it on his jacket.  What an honor!\r\n\r\nThe General's wife and two daughters, Sue and Sally were living in Savannah while he was overseas.  I recall how pleased he would be when he received their drawings and papers from school.  He would pass them around the table for all to see.\r\n\r\nI have kept in touch with General Johnson and family these many years and visited at their home in McLean, Virginia when in the D.C. area.  His daughter, Sue Vandenberg, asked me to be one of the military pall bearers at his funeral along with our other 14th wing and 44th BG members at Arlington National Cemetery.",

He handled the B24 like a fighter plane to scare the Chaplain and did a good job of it with all of us.  He landed a relieved Chaplain and then buzzed the field scattering the ground crew in all directions.\r\n\r\nOn another mission we lost an engine after take-off and were rushed to another waiting B24.  We were halfway down the runway when I discovered the control stick still strapped in place.  I alerted the co-pilot and we just managed to get off the ground.\r\n\r\nI feel very fortunate that I arrived overseas when things were more secure and I often think about the kids who were there earlier in the war and never returned.  I agree tht they should not be forgotten.",

    "bioArrivedHow": "Picked up a new plane at Topeka about Junel, then to Bangor, Maine and Goosebay, Labrador.  On to Greenlalnd, there on June 6th DDay then to Valley Wales and then to Colonto, Ireland for refresher in aircraft and Naval Ship identification, etc.  Arrived at Shipdham about July 3rd or 4th.",
    "bioTripDetails": "Flew from Bangor, Maine to Goose Bay, Labrador at night.  While over the Gulf of St. Lawrence we ran into a violent Thunderstorm. Aircraft was climbing 1000-1500 ft. a minute one second and going down 1000-1500 ft. a minute the next.  It was so violent it would take your hands off the wheel and your knees would come up and bump instrument panel when the plane dropped.  Full flaps and gear down.  St. Elmos fire on props.  Constant lightning.  Rather hair raising for ten minutes or so.\r\n\r\nWhile in Greenland (BW 1) we went down for breakfast the morning after arrival.  Everyone was crowded around the radio in the alcove just off the mess hall.  Inquired what was happening.  Was advised the invasion was on and from I could hear, it did not sound good.  Soon over the tanoy came the announcement.  \"All pilots, Co-pilots, Navigators, and Bombardiers report to the briefing room at 01200 hours\".  When faced with the unknown--one's imagination can run wild.  Mine did a good job.  They know they have 80 crews and planes here.  We will be taking off in the morning and probably land and take baggage off, load on some bombs, give us a target and away we'll go.  Then questions--Will we be able to identify enemy fighters, will we be flying in formation and will they fly the same way we had trained to fly formation.  And then all the what if's took over.  All they really wanted was to check over the plane as there had been reports of pilferage.\r\n\r\nOn our first Mision July 7th to Bernberg about 50ME109's attacked us from 12 o'clock high.  Their wings were blinking like 2 strobe lights.  None of our group got hit.  It looked like they could not miss.  As we turned off the target (as I remember)  I counted 13 planes going down and as I recall something like 90 parachutes.  It was this type of figures.  We returned home without any damage.\r\n\r\nOn one mission to Munich we ran into weather, a frontal penetration was ordered and we were to reform on top.  When we got on top, about 26000 ft., we circled for a while and no one else showed up.  We dropped our bombs in a pasture and headed for home-alone.  Fortunately there was a frontal line extending from north western France to Switzerland.  We followed the frontal line and when fighters showed up, we ducked into the cloud bank.  Made it home OK.\r\n\r\nWe were returning from a mission alone (I don't remember why) as we approached the coast in the Netherlands (near Zider Zee area) on a nice clear day, all of a sudden we lost power, as though we had chopped power.  At that instant there were four burst of some kind of shell right in front of us, it looked as though you could reach out and touch it.  The red center was about the size of a basketball as opposed to the softball size of an 88 shell.  If we had not lost power we would have been right where the shells exploded.  We had no supercharger power.  Why?  I remembered hearing something about a fuse for supercharger in training.  Maybe that had blown.  I went down below flight deck and uncovered the supercharger and found a small cover, removed it and there was a fuse.  It had blown and there was another one there.  Replaced it and then we had power and arrived home safely.  Anxious moments for awhile.  Question, how come the fuse blew at that precise moment.  Some one was looking out for us.!!!  I was later told they were an experimental 240 mm gun.\r\n\r\nWe flew a plane named Consolidate Mess for over 20 missions which was grounded for being war weary.  Most of the other missions was flow in an aircraft named Joplin Jalopy.\r\n\r\nI might add that the crew contends there were 11 aboard.  One of which we never saw.  Too many things happened-not mentioned here.  There was someone looking out for us.  Upon completing out tour we were told we were the first crew to complete 35 missions without anybody getting hurt and our crew was intact with the exception of Willis Edgecomb our \"Navigator\" who was pulled for a lead crew navigator the last 6 or 7 missions.  We had plenty of flak holes in the plane at times, 320 at one time and we lost the hydraulic system several times.  A fortunate crew with no one hurt in spite of the heavy flak at times.\r\n\r\nFinished my 35 missions November 9th, with a mission to Mets to breach the Maginot line for Patton.  I did the radio work to form the groups for this mission.\r\n\r\nS2 (Intelligence) wanted me to come with them, but when I found out I would have to fly four missions a month I thought that with 35 completed missions, my luck may have run out and turned it down as I had my orders in hand taking me off flying status.\r\n\r\nI was then sent to the 61st troop carrier command in Grantham, England, to instruct the Senior pilots on flying B-24's.  They were black and had 4-500 gallon gas tanks installed, one in each bomb bay.  I was able to go to Sherwood Forest and Robin Hood's castle in Nottingham.  I left there about the 19th of December 44 and waited at Hall, England for passage to USA.",

Finally arrived at South Wales, US Air Corp Modification Center where we surrendered our new B24J.  Our crew was separated for more training.  Gunners were sent to Northern Ireland for advanced gunnery via a B-17!.  Enjoyed steak and eggs for the first time in my life.  Yanks were fed separate from the locals as we enjoyed their scarce food.  We were also introduced to Irish Whiskey.  After completing our schooling in Northern Ireland, we left from Belfast on a small sea going vessel to Glasgow, Scotland. Then we boarded a train bound for Norwich, England and the 44th Bomb Group.  From Norwich, we traveled by truck for the Shipdham Air Base.  We arrived in Shipdham during late afternoon on Sept. 5, 1944.  It was a warm, sunny afternoon as the Captain welcomed us to the 66th Sqd.  As the Captain briefed us, the 44th BG was returning from a supply mission for the Airborne Troops at Arnhiem.  Some of the bombers were firing red flares indicating there were wounded aboard and to gain permission for priority landing.  This was our welcome to the harshness of our mission that lay ahead.",
    "bioTripDetails": "While at Westover Field, I was assigned as the tail gunner.  During training, our skipper inquired how I liked my position.  While I thought I was fine in this position he asked me if I had any problems.  I informed him that my size 13 boots would stay in the turret when exiting.  At that point, I was reassigned to fly the right waist position.  My crew consisted of the following men:\r\n\r\n          Hoffiz, Theodore B.                1sr Lieutenant                Pilot\r\n          Doswell, John P.                    1st Lieutenant                Co-Pilot\r\n          Fuchs, Albert L.                     1st Lieutenant                Navigator\r\n          Brownlee, Arthur L.                 Staff Sergeant               Nose Gunner/Toggler\r\n          Carniglia, Bernard D.               Tech Sergeant              Radio Operator/gunner  \r\n          Sisk, Quentin R.                     Tech Sergeant              Engineer/top turret gunner\r\n          Toth, Alex J                            Staff Sergeant              Right Waist Gunner\r\n          Burton, James                         Staff Sergeant              Left Waist Gunner\r\n          Allegrett, A.R.                         Staff Sergeant              Tail Gunner/Armorer\r\n\r\nAt Shipdham, the enlisted men were assigned to barracks that held about forty men in double bunks.  Our crew was lucky, we were located by the coal compound.  There was a small coal burning stove in the center of each barrack.  This stove served as the source for heating and cooking.  Somehow our limit of one box of charcoal per week never ran out.  This became very important when the weather got bad.  I fried a lot of potatoes and onions on that stove and toasted bread that we bought from the little English truck that came into the base to sell to us.\r\n\r\nThe night of September 26th, our crew was alerted that our first mission would be the next day.  I didn't get much sleep that night.  After I finally fell asleep, it seemed like no time passed at all when the CQ was shaking me.  We had to get up for breakfast and report for briefing.  Being young, energetic and patriotic, I was ready and raring to go.   We caught a truck to the mess hall.  Our pilot had flown his first mission the day before as a co-pilot, a one day on-the-job training to become familiar with his job and know what to expect on a mission.\r\n\r\nFrom the mess hall, we went to a briefing.  Things were buzzing as we were excited.  \"Attention!\" was called as the briefing officer arrived.  The room became very still as he  addressed our group.  The black curtain in front of us was drawn open.  It revealed a map of Great Britain, France, and Germany, and the Allied battle line. The target was a tank factory in Kassel, Germany.  The officer reviewed the mission, take off time, group formation, and where we would meet our \"Little Friends\", the fighter pilots.  We would be joining the 14th combat wing.  Expected flak sites were pointed out to us.  He reviewed the length of time of the bomb run and the types of bombs we would be carrying.  At the conclusion of the briefing, the officer call on our Chaplain.  A hush came over the group.  After his message and prayers, it was to the drying room to pick up our flying gear.  This included our flying suits, heated suits and oxygen masks.  We also picked up our personal weapons (a 45 caliber automatic), walk out shoes, and escape kits which we clipped to our parachute (hoping we would never need them).\r\n\r\nA truck ride took us to our aircraft.  Arrival was usually in predawn darkness.  Next, we installed our machine guns and loaded our gear by flashlight.  It quickly became apparent why, during gunnery training, we had to succesfully pass a test to assemble our weapons blindfolded.  Trucks would come by and deliver the weighty flak suits. These suits resembled catcher's chest protectors with a back.  However, these suits had a more serious purpose than baseball and many lives were saved because of them.  Plenty of time was given to check out the bomb load, the tires, the supercharger blades on the engine exhaust, safety wired gas caps, and the auxiliary power unit.  Everyone had his preflight job to do.\r\n\r\nThe pilot received orders to move the aircraft into position for takeoff.  The operation officer fired a flare into the air.  Final preparations for takeoff would then occur.  All crew would assume their designated takeoff positions.  B24s would leave the ground at one-minue intervals.  Anywhere from 36 to 40 B24s would be taking of for a normal mission. It was an exhilarating feeling to successfully become airborne.  When climbing to forming altitude, we would be on the lookout for our forming aircraft \"Lemon Drop\" was name of our orange and black vertically stripped forming B24.  She would fire the designated colors of flares so that we could form our bomb group in her area.\r\n\r\nOver the English Channel, our pilot would clear us to test fire our weapons.  As we flew closer to our target and climbed to our bombing altitude, everyone performed necessary tasks to ensure all systems were working.  We stayed on constant alertness for enemy aircraft.  We had plenty of flak that first mission but we were in luck.  There was a solid cloud coverage providing us protection. These conditions prevented the Germans from having true aim.  A screening force flew in ahead of the bomber stream.  Their mission was to drop chaff (tin foil) to give false readings on the enemy's anti-aircraft screens. Each plane would also drop chaff.\r\n\r\nWe approached the target area and turned in on our bomb run.  The bomb bay doors were opened.  The nose gunner and togglier closely watched the lead aircraft to see when he dropped his bombs.  This signaled for the togglier to flip the bomb release switch.  Bombs rained down on our target.  After dropping our bombs, I checked to verify that the bomb bay was clear.  While returning to my position, the call came \"bandits!\".  Enemy aircraft were sighted.  As we made our turn right off the target, I looked out the waist window to see bombers and fighters engaged in heavy combat.  I can still visualize the air war being fought by that group of bombers in the distance.  Later at interrogation, we learned it was the 445th BG that was severely hit with heavy losses.  Thirty-two aircraft went to the target and twenty-eight were shot down that day from the 445th BG.  Only four from that BG returned from their target.  I quickly learned what personal risks were at stake.\r\n\r\nDecember 16th to the 24th was a bad time for our Armed Forces.  The Germans broke through our ground forces.  This event led to the \"Battle of the Bulge\". The Air Corp was summoned to fly several times during that period.  We would take off and be recalled due to bad weather unable to leave England air space.  During one of these recalls our tail gunner, Al Allegretti, called out \"B24, 6 o'clock level! \"Get her down skipper!\"  Our plane dropped to avoid being rammed by one of our own, not knowing as we did, if we were clear below.  Another recall had us landing at an unfamiliar B24 base. Visibility was 400 ft.  We had a full load of bombs and fuel on board.  Our pilot used instruments to land.  We all experienced \"instant religion\" and were grateful for a safe landing by our excellent pilot.\r\n\r\nThe morning of December 24, 1944, the weather finally broke.  The weather cleared enough to fly and we were going to deliver our \"presents\" to the Germans.  It was our 16th mission.  A maximum effort was called for, anything that could fly was put in the air.  Even Lemon Drop, our forming aircraft, was outfitted with bombs for this mission.  A total of 61 aircraft from the 44th BG went up that day.  The winter of 44-45 was the worst in fifty years.  There was a lot of snow and freezing temperatures.  Our soldiers needed help.  We were to bomb transportation routes.  Our targets were railroads, bridges and tunnels that were located north of Trier, Germany.  On the way over, the German 88's were hammering at us.  The ground was snow covered and I could see the muzzle flashes of ak ak guns that stood out against the snowy background.  In a matter of seconds after seeing the orange flashes, black puffs with red centers would appear near out aircraft.  Luckily, they didn't score and we successfully dropped our bombs.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't until years later that I found out my former fellow soldiers of the 78th Infantry Division were engaged in the ground war that day.  My friends of the Division described how the heavy bombers arrived on the scene from their perspective.  First, tiny specks appeared with faint noise in the background.  The noise of the engines grew until it blocked out all other sound.  As the heavy bombers came closer, the ground shook, so great was the air power that day.  Twenty five hundred aircraft took part in the mission.  The foot soldiers were so happy to see the arrival of aircraft, they left their foxholes to cheer and wave us on.  This maximum effort helped stop the Germans from advancing.  Supplies to the Germans were successfully cut off and our soldiers were able to turn the battle around.\r\n\r\nBetween missions we tried to keep ourselves entertained.  We wanted to keep our minds off the war and feel sane.  We played checkers and cards, rode around the base on bikes, shot skeet, and went to Norwich via truck.  Occasionally, there were dances on the base.  I read a lot of books and wrote a lot of letters to my friends, family and my sweetheart, Olga Mae.  We biked to some of the closer towns like Shipdham quite often.  We stopped at the pubs, drank their warm beer and spirits and ate a lot of fish and chips wrapped in newspaper.  Periodically, we would get a three-day pass and head for London to experience the sights..\r\n\r\nOn January 14th, 1945, I received a three-day pass.  On the last day, I missed the six o'clock return train.  This meant I had to take a later train and I arrived back in Norwich at 12:05 am.  On this particular night, there was an E.T.O. restriction.  Upon returning to the base, the MP checked my normal pass.  I was written up and \"busted\" from SSgt to private.  I flew the next 12 missions as a private.\r\n\r\nJanuary 16th, 1945, was our mission to Dresden, Germany, Marshalling Yard.  This was our longest mission.  Bomb bay fuel tanks were installed in the aircraft due to the distance of our target.  The farther that you flew to deliver the bombs, the more fuel you needed.  Therefore, you carried less bombs and vice versa.  The engineer had to transfer the fuel from the auxiliary tanks to the main fuel cells in the wings.  As we flew the mission, the gauges had to be checked.  The engine that was consuming the most fuel was serviced first.  In his book entitled \"Slaughter House Five\", American author Kurt Vounnegot wrote about this battle. He was a Prisoner of War in Dresden, Germany during this time.\r\n\r\nOn February 26th our mission took us to the \"Big B\"...Berlin.  The target was Pankow, Marshalling Yard.  There was a saying that a B24 could leave its wheels down and taxi its way across Berlin on the flak that was put up.  It was another lucky day for us.  We came back safely.  We rode the jet stream to Berlin 100 mph faster. The tail wind was with us.  On returning to base, our indicated airspeed was 65 mph as we fought the head winds.  It was also during this mission that a 1000 pound bomb failed to release and drop normally.  It was my job to release it manually.  This meant I had to stand on a main 8 inch I beam over the open bomb bay door in 60 degree weather wearing a five-minute supply oxygen bottle while I performed this task   This needed to be accomplished before leaving the enemy territory. This was the fifth time I had to say farewell to one of our bombs in this manner.\r\n\r\nOn our mission of March 8th 1945, I received my Sergeant stripes back.  It was our 30th mission.  It was also on this mission that our pilot, Ted Hoffiz, brought a Chaplain to me.  Ted informed me the Chaplain was going to fly with us on this mission and that I was to take care of him.  The Chaplain had decided that he wanted to witness first hand what the air crews experienced during their missions.  Often, the Chaplain served as our spiritual and sometimes our psychological support when our loses were great and our spirits were low.  The mission seemed routine until we received a radio message to recall us due to poor weather.  This call came late in the mission and although we were already over Germany, we had to return to base.  We were frustrated and disappointed.  The Chaplain was on the radio (VHR) listening to the radio conversation.  I'm sure he heard an ear full.  On March 12th the Chaplain did complete a bombing mission with Pilot Newton E, Condray to Wetzlar, Germany.  It was not until February 2000, that I learned the Chaplain's name was William R.Cain.\r\n\r\nMarch 15, 1945 was the mission for which I was looking.  It was number thirty-five--Our last mission!!  The closer we came to that mission the further away and the more elusive it seemed.  Our risks became more of a reality with every mission.  We were very aware of all the things that could or might happen.  We had been fortunate enough to make it this far but would we be lucky enough to make it home?  Would we see our loved ones again?  These were the things we all thought and felt in our hearts but they remained unspoken.\r\n\r\nThe mission was to Zossen, 20 miles south of Berlin.  The target was the General Staff Headquarters for the German armies. We dropped delayed action bombs on the target.  These bombs never, ever returned to the air base.  The acid activated detonation fuse was too dangerous.  The jar of landing the plane was enough to activate the bomb.  We flew deputy lead that day.  We completed our 35 missions.  We were blessed.  It was time for the celebration.  Our crew was asked to consider flying lead aircraft in the formation for five more missions.  We respectfully declined.\r\n\r\nMilitary records indicate that our crew flew 39 missions but we were only credited with 35.  On several of our missions, we had a K20 camera on board.  I took pictures of our formations, the bomb strikes and whatever action occurred during the missions from the back hatch.  There were other \"close calls\" for our crew that included an on-board fire, engines shot out, engines lost due to loss of oil pressure and returning to base with dangerously low fuel.\r\n\r\nOur crew experienced many things together.  We had low fuel problems twice.  After Ken indicated we were our condition, we came down through an overcast sky to about 3,000 ft.  We flew up to St. Quentin.  The runways were full of craters.  The next closest air base was Manston which was across the channel about 90 miles away.  After another reading on our fuel\r\ntanks, the skipper related our alternatives.  We told him we were with him and stayed with the aircraft.  We threw everything out that wasn't fastened down in the English Channel.  Skipper called Manston and identified us.  A WAFF in the control tower said standby for landing instructions.  Skipper said, \"Clear the deck, we're coming in\".  We did go in and followed the vehicle to the parking area.  We checked the fuel tanks and found enough fuel for another five minutes.  We were lucky.\r\n\r\nOn another hair-raising experience, after bombs away order was given, the bomb bay doors wouldn't close.  The auxiliary vacuum pump switch was thrown to assist the doors to close.  The dreaded alarm came, fire in the bomb bay again.  We lucked out.  We got the doors closed and the switch turned off, and a shot of CO2 put out the fire.\r\n\r\nOn a mission to Magdenbury, it was a clear day.  The refinery was on fire from being hit by the planes in formation ahead of us.  Smoke was coming up to about 10 or 12 thousand feet.  Skipper called out that three air craft in that group were hit and going down.  I saw five parachutes.  Flak was accurate.\r\n\r\nWe may have been one of the first groups to see the ME262 in action.  One came in on us head on. Art fired on him and said he hit him.  I could not see the ME262 from my position.  He broke down before flying through the formation.\r\n\r\nI helped Joy on another mission when I discovered him on the floor.  I observed his oxygen regulator wasn't blinking indicating his O2 was not flowing.  I flipped the regulator to bypass and found his hose was pinched between the back of his flak suit and his body.  I had to restrain Joy when he was recovering from his ordeal.\r\n\r\nI managed to get frost bite on the right cheek, ear and beneath my chin.  I was grounded for a week.  After that I wore two wool hoods.  Luckily, the crew wasn't assigned to fly in that period of time.  Therefore, I never missed any missions.\r\n\r\nUsing a relief tube wasn't much of a chore, but to defecate was something else.  It was necessary to use a box usually the chaff box.  I had to unplug my heated suit at the waist, then pull down heated pants which exposed skin to the temperature which was 30 or more degrees below zero, and finally throwing it out the back hatch.\r\n\r\nThe air craft controls were harder to operate in the cold temperature.  It affected the guns and turrets.  The new bib overall type pants with its alpaca lining and the down filled parkas with fur hoods were great.\r\n\r\nI think it was about our 19th mission when the flight surgeon came to our table.  We drinking coffee and whiskey.  He asked, \"Would you boys like to go on a rest leave?\"  We responded with a \"No sir, thank you\".  He directed our attention elsewhere and dropped a metal ash tray on the floor.  We all jumped.  He said, \"Men, pack your bags.  You're going on a rest leave.\"\r\n\r\nIt was at this time, before the rest leave, I saw this individual sitting in the mess hall. As I came in he looked up.  He was wearing an auburn mustache.  His name was Bob Vance, we had both spent time in the 78th Infantry Division and met on our way to the air cadets.  We renewed our friendship.  The only time I ever sweated out a mission was March 24, 1945.  We all knew our group went in low level to drop supplies. Two of our air craft from the group were shot down.  Bob and Lou DeBlasio were the only survivors.  I did not learn this until years later.  I was grateful and happy to learn that Bob came back.  We look forward to being together at our reunions.\r\n\r\nMany interesting things happened in the barracks.  Loppy, as the man was called, probably came over to the 44th.  He was separated from his crew and flew as a spare gunner and finished his tour.  A big party ws held at the EM Club.  Dave, Jim Walker and Wiley got a keg of cider and brought it back to the squadron and the party continued.  Needless to say, some of the men were well under the influence.  Wiley was sitting on a 5 gallon jerry can used for water.  Walker was standing with a 45 automatic in his hand.  Someone turned off the lights and we heard a bang.  The lights came back on.  Wiley was shot in the hand.  The next morning there was a big investigation.  No one knew anything.  Walker wound up in the Guard House.  As the story goes, General Johnson saw Walker under guard.  He was supposed to have said get him out of the guard house, finish his missions and rotate him.  Jim was married to an English girl.  He had the DFC with two clusters and 7 German fighters to his credit.  He also had the Air Medal with clusters.\r\n\r\nOf all the things that I encountered in the Army Air Corps, I am most grateful and thankful that I transferred from the Infantry.  When I returned from a mission, I had hot food and a bed there for me.  Our fellow foot soldiers did not and I remained ever thoughtful of the 78th Infantry Division in which I started. Years later, I learned of the very heavy casualties this Division sacrificed for our freedom.",

I would rather have flown back but didn't have that option.  The trip home aboard the ship was another experience.\r\n\r\nWhen we boarded it was late afternoon in time for dinner.  On boarding I noticed we were moving up and down with the tide.  I asked a sailor when this movement was going to stop.  He told me it wouldn't and that it would only get worse.  The Ship's Officer explained to us that there were a number of liberated American Prisoners of War on board and they were in poor health.  He asked if we would be willing to volunteer extra duty to maintain the smooth operation of the ship.  On this twelve-day trip home, tha airmen did all the extra duties on board including KP, garbage detail, swabbing decks, etc.  After seeing the condition of some of the POWs, we were only too happy  to do this work.  We were thankful that we had been in the Air Corps rather than the Infantry.\r\n\r\nDuring the trip, I became acquainted with one POW who told me he was in the Army 6 months to the day and 5 1/2 of these months were spent in a POW.  Several of these men died on the voyage home.\r\n\r\nTo make things more interesting, our convoy was followed for two days by the German U Boars.  Our guys were dropping depth charges.  I arrived home on May 1, 1945 and was able to celebrate VE day stateside May 8, 1945 with may family and Olga, the woman who would become my wife.",

We had 3 double bunks in our cabin.  Some had eight bunks, but there were no complaints.",
    "bioTripDetails": "On January 18, 1944, orders from 8th AF Hdq. assigned four 2nd Lt. WAC Women Officers to the four Combat Bombardment Wings (B-24H) in 2nd Division as Cryptographic Security Officers.  Glamorous as it may sound, being the only female military person on the base was unparalleled, uncomfortable and at times a lonely situation.  You didn't have another woman to talk with!  However, we \"gals\" did manage to visit each other when we could \"hop a flight\" to their respective wing station or take leave as we did to London, Scotland, and Paris after cessation of European activities.\r\n\r\nThe men who worked in these Code Rooms were well trained and extremely competent.  Those in the 44th Code Room were tops.\r\n\r\nI remember the night when a tap on my window woke me and I was informed that a TOP SECRET message had come in and a vehicle with an armed guard would take me down to the Code Room to handle the message and deliver such to Gen. Johnson.\r\n\r\nI can clearly recall the day we were alerted that some of our code machines and systems had possibly been compromised by the Germans during the Normandy Beach invasions.  This meant \"scrubbing\" those systems and immediately going over to a different procedure.  As it turned out the position had not been over-run, but we couldn't take any chances.\r\n\r\nI had a chance to go up in a B-24 at Shipdham.  It was quite a project to get me into the heavy insulated leather flight suit.  We needed to find the smallest size available and to add a parachute.  We were not high enough to need an oxygen mask.\r\n\r\nI had a chance to see all the stations-radio, tail gunner, waist gunner and the Norden Bomb site in the nose.\r\n\r\nAnother flight on a B-24 was when  we took a crew to Birmingham so they could return to the states.  Coming back we were on instruments all the way.  \"That blew my mind\". You couldn't see a thing then our first view was the estate house/manor at the end of the Shipdham runway.  WOW!\r\n\r\nOn August 25, 1944 the Glenn Miller concert was held in the hangar at 392nd Bomb Group in Wendling.  I feel very fortunate to have a picture taken of me standing on the stage with Glenn Miller.  He had asked me to come forward to draw names in a War Bond promotion.  His band toured many of the 8th AF bases.\r\n\r\nAs time went on with the war effort there was less and less need ot use code methods for some of our transmissions and much was put over to PL (Plain Language).  I was then a lst Lt. and on Feb. 25, 1945 was appointed A-3 (Watch Officer) 14th CBWand and worked in Wing Control Center preparing briefing information for missions and controlling and monitoring mission activities until the cessation of hostilities on May 9, 1945.\r\n\r\nUsually, with completion of the 200th mission, a bomb group would stage a big party/celebration with parades, and possible fly overs, etc.  All extra work for many and in particular for the enlisted, ground crew and mechanics.\r\n\r\nGeneral Leon W. Johnson felt very strongly that all should enjoy the day off.  He issued \"SPECIAL ORDERS\" commanding all offices to exchange duty with their \"enlisted counterparts\" where ever it was possible and to exchange insignia and carry out the duties of their \"newly\" assigned counterpart.  A complete reversal of roles and duties where ever and when ever possible.\r\n\r\nBeer barrels were located at the various intersections through-out the base-figures say 2000 gals.  Gambling tables were set up in a hangar and the \"famous 44th Combat Bomb Group's Flying Eight-Balls\" had a BALL!\r\n\r\nGeneral Johnson replaced the one star flag on his vehicle with a special flag of three stripes for his driver, Sgt. Fusano and drove him around the base where ever he wished to go.  When Sgt. Johnson drove up to the main gate of the 44th BG with the \"new\" General Fusano in the back seat, the group executive officer carried out the duties of the gate keeper and gave Sgt. Johnson a bad time.\r\n\r\nGeneral Johnson was \"Lynched\" and taken down to the duck pond near one of the squadron mess halls and thrown in.  Great fun was had by all.  Later in the day Col. John Gibson and I were also \"lynched\" and met the same fate.  A great 200th Party!\r\n\r\nGeneral Johnson was deeply concerned for every single person in his command.  He went out of his way to see that their needs and wishes were met.  He was highly thought of by all who served with him.\r\n\r\nEarly on, his driver Sgt. Fusano was instructed to automatically stop and pick up any member of the base who was walking along the road from squadron sites to the base headquarters, hangars and dispersal area or flight lines.  The base was pretty much spread out over the flat, flat, flat, English country side.  An ideal situation where General Johnson could talk with his men and learn about their gripes and problems. \r\n\r\nWhen I arrived at the 14th Combat Wing, I was given quarters and assigned to the Wing Club Room and dining area.  There were slightly more than a dozen officers, it was very informal and we had our meals there with General Johnson.  This was the room that had all the \"Wall Art\" that we hear about.  Possibly this building may be repaired as an historical marker.\r\n\r\nI had been there only a few days when General Johnson showed me his Congressional Medal of Honor ribbon and asked if I would please sew it on his jacket.  What an honor!\r\n\r\nThe General's wife and two daughters, Sue and Sally were living in Savannah while he was overseas.  I recall how pleased he would be when he received their drawings, and papers from school.  He would pass them around the table for all to see.\r\n\r\nI have kept in touch with General Johnson and family these many years and visited at their home in McLean, Virginia when in the D.C. area.  His daughter, Sue Vandenberg asked me to be one of the military pall bearers at his funeral along with our other 14th wing and 44th BG members at Arlington National Cemetery.",

The weather was so bad we sent to Miami, Fl to fly the southern route to Puerto Rica then to Trinidad from there to Belem, Brazil then to Natal, Brazil.  We were supposed to go directly to Accra, Africa but there was a German sub in the Atlantic and we had to wait until this was cleared so we went to Rio De Janero for a few days, then back to Natal, the sub was gone, and we started across the Atlantic.  We landed at Accra then to Marrakech, Morocco.  We were supposed to go directly to England but since we had not been given an arrival date, we thought we would see North Africa.  We went to Cairo and then to Jerusalem back to Marrakech and then we proceeded to England.  Landed at Newquay and called 8th AF Headquarters to find out where to go.  We went to the 44th BG at Shipdham.",
    "bioTripDetails": "The record that is shown in this Biography is taken from the book that Jim Selasky compiled.\r\n\r\nAfter enlisting in the Regular Army at Indian Gap, PA., I was transferred to Maxwell Field, Montgomery, AL. I was with 2000 or more draftees, at Maxwell, we slept in a hangar and went through Boot Camp.  At Maxwell Field I saw Air Force Cadets which impressed me very much.  I decided that I would get in the Cadets if at all possible after I finished Boot Camp.  I was sent to Craig Field, Selma, AL.  While at Craig I checked into entry in the Cadets.  I found it to be 2 years of college or pass an equivalency test.  Immediately, I bought books and started studying every spare minute I had.  The next test was scheduled for October.  By then I was ready and went to Maxwell Field for the exam. The exam lasted 5 days - 8 hours a day.It was the hardest exam I had ever taken.  I felt positive I had passed and was notified just before Thanksgiving I had passed and would be in the next Cadet Class starting in December.\r\n\r\nAfter taking preflight training at Maxwell Field, Al., I was sent to Avon Park, FL. to begin flight training.  After washing out of flying school, I was notified that I would go to Navigation School.\r\n\r\nI graduated from Navigation School December 26, 1942 at Monroe, LA.  After graduation from Cadets, I was sent to Salt Lake City, UT. for assignment.  We first went to Tuscon,AZ.\r\n\r\nHere I was assigned to a crew, except we didn't have a pilot.  We were sent to Almagordo, NM for so called overseas training, but no one seemed to know what we were supposed to do.  The first Pilot assigned to us committed suicide.  He was afraid of going overseas. Then Reginald Carpenter was assigned to us and we started practising bombing, gunnery and  distance navigation.  We did not have a schedule and could go anywhere we wanted to go as long as we got clearance.  We flew all over the country and made two trips to Hawaii.  We finally received orders to go overseas and went to Bangor, Maine.  From Bangor we were supposed to cross the Atlantic but the weather was so bad, they send us to Miami to fly the Southern Route to England.  We were sent to the 44th Bomb Group at Shipdham about 15 miles from Norwich.\r\n\r\nWe flew a few easy missions and then bombed Kiel, Germany.  After that we didn't have an 8th AF left.  At this time we only had four groups of heavy bombers in England, two B-17 groups and 2-B-24 groups.  For about a month we practised low level flying, night flying with an unlit runway and attended British lectures on night missions.  In the latter part of June we went to North Africa.  The B-17's did not go with us.  We were stationed at Benghazi, Algeria.  From there we supported the ground troops with expelling the Germans from North Africa. We also practised low level flying.  In August, we were ordered to bomb the Ploesti Oil Refinery in Romania.  We thought they were kidding at first because this was beyond our range.  On careful calculation, we determined if we used four engines on take-off, two engines to the target, four over the target and two engines back home we might make it.  They gave us last rites before taking off, so it didn't look too promising.\r\n\r\nI flew as group Navigator on this mission with Colonel Johnson.  He flew Co-Pilot and Major Brandon was Pilot.  Each small group of planes on this mission had specific areas of this oil complex to as their target.  The first two groups to hit the target made a mistake and randomly bombed the target.  When our group hit the target our area was completely on fire with explosions occurring everywhere.  Reg Carpenter and our regular crew were flying off our left wing.  His plane was badly shot up.  The #1 engine was pointing straight down and it seemed you could look right through the fuselage anywhere you looked.  He went down in the Mediterranean sea about six hours later, 180 miles from our airfield.  We made it with one wounded crewman.  The next day we hunted for Reg for about ten hours but never found him.  The British found him and what was left of the crew two days later.  Once again after this mission, we no longer had a group.\r\n\r\nWe spent another week in Africa repairing what was left of the group and then flew back to England.  We spent about a month in England hitting targets in France, Germany and Norway.  Then we went back to Africa for the invasion of Sicily.  This time we were stationed south of Tunis.  We bombed Sicily and Southern Italy every day until the ground troops were well established.  Then once again we started bombing the supply routes to the area.  On October 1st our target was the Foche-Wolfe fighter factory at Wiener Neustadt just south of Vienna, Austria.  We were shot down about 20 miles after we left the target.\r\n\r\nWhen  I bailed  out of our plane I counted to 15 and then pulled the ripcord to my chest chute.  We wore 2 chutes, one seat pack and one chest chute.  My chute opened without any trouble.  I saw quite a few other chutes in area.  I saw two men go down their chutes trailing but never opening.  Apparently these men had only one chute.  I also saw one man whose chute was on fire.  It had opened but it kept burning and he kept falling faster and faster.  A fighter ME-109 came at me and I thought I had had it, but his wings never lit up, as they did when their guns were firing.  He flew by and wiggled his wings, a form of greeting used by Pilots.  As I approached the ground I could see I was going to land in a clump of trees so I doubled up and put my arms in front of my face.  I didn't hit a thing, I ended up swinging under a huge Oak tree suspended about 30 feet from the ground.  I could see soldiers in the distance.  I got out of my harness, hung from it, and dropped to the ground. I landed on a steep slope and rolled down the hill.  At the bottom of slope was a foot path and about 10 yards further wa a creek about 30 feet wide.  I went into the water and waded up stream.  How far I waded I don't know but I came to a very small heavily bushed Island.  I crawled in the brush and hid.  I then took stock of what I had, a hunting knife, 2 candy bars, 4 extra clips for my 45, and an escape kit.  My holster was empty apparently my 45 fell out when I bailed out.  I buried the holster and extra clips then opened the escape kit.  This kit was supposed to have amap, dictionaries for the area, pills to keep you awake and other stuff I don't remember.  The map was of France, Holland and Belgium, and the only dictionary was French.  Like everything else Intelligence told us in those days this was totally useless.\r\n\r\nAll that day I watched German soldiers walk up and down either side of the creek.  In late afternoon the Germans came with dogs and went past the Island and on downsteam. I heard a commotion downstream so I figured that had gone into to the creek but they didn't know where I went from there.\r\n\r\nAll night I stayed on that Island and nearly froze.  I was wet up to my waist and had on Khakis which didn't keep me very warm.  I did have on my flight jacket which helped some.  All night the German's with dogs and flashlights went up and down either side of the shore.  Needless to say I didn't sleep.  The next day the patrols slacked off about noon and I decided to try and make it to a train track downstream.  All night and the previous day I had heard train whistles.  I walked mostly in the stream, but I came to a bridge where they had narrowed the stream and the water was deep.  I decided to go around the bridge instead of swimming.  I stayed in the woods and brush as best I could but I finally came to an open field.  In the middle of the field was 3 soldiers, a dog and a farmer.  The wind was blowing hard toward me and away from the dog so I felt safe.  But that dog put his nose up and came straight at me.  End of my escape!!  I ended up in a village jail with one cell.  Sgt. Booker, our right waist gunner, was already there.  All day long the villagers came and gawked at us.  Late that night we were loaded on a truck with other prisoners and taken to Vienna.  In Vienna the officers were separated from enlisted personnel and I never saw Booker again. In Vienna I joined Carpenter, Carol Pratt, and others from our group and other groups.  A few days later they put us on trains and took us to Frankfurt to the Interrogation Center. \r\n\r\nAt Dulag Luft, the Interrogation Center, we were put in completely dark, sound-proof cells.  I soon learned that in a completely dark cell you couldn't stand up unless you were touching a wall.  If you stood up in the middle of the floor you would eventually fall.  They would slide food in a small door on a tray with a pitcher of water.  We got two meals a day  pitcher.  We got a meal in the morning consisting of a bowl of Oatmeal, husks included and a piece of black bread.  Later in the day we would get a bowl of broth, potatoes or rutabagas and another piece of bread.  Every night the British bombers would bomb Frankfurt which was only a few miles from where we were.  The second day I was there I found a partially loose board in the floor in the middle of the room.  I worked it loose and removed the nails so I could put the board back in the floor. Under the building was about 2 feet of crawl space.  The exterior of the building was rock but it had narrow ventilation slits in it about 4\" wide and about a foot high.  At least I could see outside and tell whether it was night or day.  They had taken all our possessions including our belts.  Through the ventilation slit I could see we were on a high hill overlooking Frankfurt.  At night I would watch the British bomb and felt sorry for the crews.  They would bomb from 12,000 feet which made them sitting ducks for every flak gun the Germans had.  They would come in one at a time, about every 15 minutes and the search lights would pick them up.  How any of them got through was amazing but it seemed like only about 1 in 10 would go down which really wasn't as bad as we had suffered up until that time. They would keep coming until about 2 hours before dawn.  When they left it seemed like the whole town was on fire but later in the day you could see much of the town was still standing.  That night the British would be back!!  I didn't mention before that in one corner of the cell there was a hole which was used for defecation and urination.  The hole was baffled so you could not see anything under the building.  You had to be careful crawling around under the building.  After four days they gave us a shower, our belts and interrogated us.  They took us on trucks to as near as they could in the bombed out town then marched us the rest of the way to the railroad.  I had some apprehension about walking through this town that had been bombed so much but the people looked at us with dazed stares as if we weren't even there.  We were put on trains and sent to Sagan about 90 miles SE of Berlin.\r\n\r\nWhen we got off the train it was snowing.  A bunch of SS troops were loading another train bound for the Russian front.  They were a fine looking group of soldiers. \r\n\r\nOur Bombardier,  Bill Swenson, never did show up.  The last sight of him I had was when I handed him his chest chute.  He was sitting on his machine guns.  Reg Carpenter said that after he was captured they took him to see a body in the middle of a field.  The chute had not opened.  He couldn't identify the man because of the condition of the body.  He couldn't even tell if the man had on 2 chutes .  All the men in our group wore 2 chutes.\r\n\r\nWhen we got to Stalag Luft III the British were still in the process of moving out of the building we were to move into.  The building was filthy.  We had noticed in England that the ordinary Englishman wasn't the cleanest person in the world, but this building we moved into was downright filthy.  We scrubbed everything.  The Germans cooperated with us giving us all the soap and scrub brushes we needed, new straw for what we used as mattresses and even fumigated the building.  We finally got set up and in our little group, called combines, there were the following originally, Carpenter, Carol Pratt, myself, Tom Hyde, Tom Hobson and Arthur Callahan.  Each combine was arranged around a table.  Things were arranged this way because that is how the Germans wanted it.\r\n\r\nThe first month or six weeks I spent making pots and pans.  We copied these from British and Americans who had arrived before us.  All pots and pans had to be made a certain size so a maximum  number could be put on the stove and in the oven.  Pots and Pans were made from tin cans we received in Red Cross parcels.  The only tool we had for this was a kitchen knife.  Each combine also had a large butcher knife and paring knife but these could not be used as tools.  We cut the cans by splitting them down the side, removing bottom and flattening them out.  Then cut them as needed by putting them on the table over a crack.  A knife was inserted in the crack and the tin was cut where we wanted.  Seams were made as sheet metal men make duct seams.  Callahan and myself made all the pots and pans for our combine.  The rest of the men were useless when it came to working with their hands.  We got pretty good at this and could make most anything we wanted if we had enough tin.  These pots and pans leaked when they were first made but boiling oatmeal, hulls and all, soon clogged all the leaks.\r\n\r\nAfter getting organized, I started attending classes.  We got up at 6 for roll call.  Apfel in German.  After that the day was ours to do as we pleased.  Two men were on cooking duty, washing dishes, tables etc. for a week then we would switch off.  Breakfast was oatmeal and 1 slice of l/8\" thick German blackbread.  Very thin coffee if we had it.  Lunch was broth by Germans and 1 slice of bread.  Dinner was our big meal and was anything we could make from what we got in Red Cross parcels plus what the Germans gave us.  Sometimes they gave us potatoes, or rutabagas or cabbage.  The broth they gave us for luch was apparently made from horse's or cow's heads. Every once in awhile you would find an eye in the broth so we called it \"seeing eye soup\".  We didn't starve but we were always very hungry.\r\n\r\nWe had all kinds of activities to engage in.  We had baseball equipment, volley balls and nets, footballs, ice skates, musical instruments and of pretty good supply of books.  We also had courses we could take in just about anything we wanted.  I concentrated on math, science and reading history as well as softball and football.  I exercised every day to keep in condition.  Some men did nothing except lay in bed and feel sorry for themselves.  We had a few of those in our combine.  Others dug tunnels, none successful from our compound, while others tried other schemes to escape.  One man we had escaped 13 times, but was either caught or came back on his own.\r\n\r\nWilliam P. Newbold was my best friend in the prison camp.  Bill broke his leg when landing in his parachute.  He arrived in Stalag Luft III about a month after the rest of the survivors from the 44th.  He had been in a clinic for survivors getting his leg attended to.  I didn't know Bill before the POW camp.  He was in the same group but different squadrons.  My first contact with Bill was the night I spent making navigation maps for a mission with other staff officers, and the next morning I was advised that Bill Newbold would lead the mission.  I briefed Bill and then went to bed.  The mission was a freight yard somewhere in Italy (don't remember where).  I got up at noon and went to the flight line. The group was supposed to be back at about 5 in the afternoon but they were about an hour late.  In that hour I rechecked all my calculations and it all seemed okay.  Later on I found out they had a terrific wind shift plus engine trouble.   Anyway,  one day I came back to the combine and the Germans had put another bunk above mine.  Shortly Bill Newbold was brought in and we became good friends.\r\n\r\nEveryone settled into their own routine and things stayed status quo through the winter and summer of '44.  The buildings were not heated, but we became used to cold and there wasn't much complaining.  In the fall more and more POW's came in and by November all bunks were stacked 3 high.  In the middle of November Col. Spivey told there was a possibility we would be marched out of camp and advised everyone to exercise and get their legs in shape.  I built a knapsack carrier with shoulder straps and head band and was ready.  Sometime after Christmas of '44 we were ordered by the Germans to move out.  The Russians were approaching from the East.  It was dark, cold and snowing when we left stalag Luft III.  We walked continuously that night and the next day.  That night we stopped at a farm and slept outside.  The next day we walked again.  Two of the men from our combine got sick and Bill and I pulled them on makeshift sleds.  We slept outside again that night.  Next day we walked again but only had to pull one man on a sled that day.  We walked 4 or 5 days sleeping outside or in bombed out buildings.  We ended up in a burnt out old factory building, where we stayed a couple of days and then was crowded on box cars.  We were so crowded that only so many men could sit at one time.  The rest had to stand.  When we left Stalag Luft III they had given us all the Red Cross parcels we thought we could carry.  This is what we ate during this trip.  When we got to Nurenberg we were let out of the box car for the first time.  It was a large railroad station.  It made no difference to us, we took down our pants and defecated.  We were put back on the box car and went to Mooseburg.  Mooseburg was the most dismal place I have ever seen.  It was some kind of old manufacturing plant.  The bunks were stacked three high and crowded in as close as they could be.  It was cold, filthy, full of bugs and rats and the toilet facilities were about a block away and completely inadequate.  All we got to eat at Mooseburg was what the Germans gave us which was starvation rations.  We were liberated by General Patton's army about April 26, 1945.  We were told we would be flown out but not WHEN.  After we were 'liberated' we did not receive any food at all except what we could beg, steal of take from the Germans in the area.  After 3 or 4 days I got tired of this nonsense and decided to start out on my own.  We had been advised to stay in camp.  Bill Newbold wouldn't go with me so I teamed up with a guy by the name of Bill Huebner and we started walking.  We came to a busy highway and got a ride on a truck to Nurenburg. There the MP's directed us to an old German airfield.  We went there, but it was a waste of time.  The field was a complete wreck and some other POW's had been there for as long as a week.  We didn't even stay the night and started walking again.  About midnight we ended up at a desolate small intersection guarded by a GI.  He had a fire going and plenty of \"K\" Rations which he shared with us.  A car came along driven by a German.  He stopped the car and took the German off into the woods.  He motioned us to take the car.  The car was fueled by small wooden blocks, soaked in methane which burned in a burner in the trunk.  We had to stop about every 10 miles or so and put more wood in the burner.  We got to the Autobon and drove to Frankfurt.  There we went to an old German airbase which was occupied by Americans.   We got some decent food, new clothes and $1,000 each in cash from any Finance Officer just by presenting our POW ID.  We were feeling a 100% better and some mechanics converted the car we had back to gasoline.  Huebner and I decided to see some of Europe.  We traveled south through Germany and France to Marsailles and Monte Carlo.  We were going to go to Italy but was getting the urge to go home.  Drove back to Paris and got a flight on a transport to LeHavre, France which was a main point of debarcation to US.  Was there a few days and then got on a ship for USA. \r\n\r\nWe spent 21 days on 550' \"Victory\" Merchant Marine vessel coming home.  We started from LeHavre, France.  For some unknown reason I was made Mess Officer.  We had 750 enlisted men and about 100 officers on board.  All were infantry POW,s I was the only Air Force Officer on board.\r\n\r\nWe went to Blackpool, England for supplies.  I had no idea what we would need so I ordered 5 tons of everything they had.\r\n\r\nThis ship had been partially converted to carry German POW's to the US.  It did not have accomodations for as many as we had.  After loading supplies we joined a convoy forming East of Ireland.  We were the flagship of the convoy.  It took me three days, 24 hours a day, to get cooking facilities set up for the many men we had.  The Merchant Marine Engineer on the ship helped us.  We set up steam tables, built ovens and large steam pots.  I was also fortunate in selecting a hard nosed, big, Master Sergeant as Mess Sergeant.  He ruled the enlisted men with an iron fist.  After getting things organized we served 5 meals a day with continuous snacks of chicken or turkey.  We had a Medical Officer on board and he made us boil or steam everything for 5 days because of the condition of the men.  After that we cooked anyway we wanted.  We were fortunate to find some very good cooks among the men and for the last 16 days ate very good.  All the men were very undernourished from being POW's .  We had chicken, turkey, filet mignon steaks, \"T\" Bones, potatoes and all the canned vegetables and fruit imaginable.  We also had fresh apples and grapes.  The two fresh things we didn't have, that caused complaints, was milk and eggs.\r\n\r\nOur convoy had over 100 ships in it not counting the Navy Destroyers and Cruisers.  We came back the Northern Route.  Three days out we ran into icebergs, then heavy fog.  The ship could only communicate using signal lights.  We had a radio blackout.  In the midst of the fog and icebergs the order was given to turn.  Only half the ships got the order.  When the turn was made there were numerous collisions.  Luckily none of the ships sunk or had to be abandoned.  A ship rammed the rear end of our ship and bent the propeller and shaft. After the collision our maximum speed was 4 knots, so we were a long time getting to New York.  We finally arrived in NY on June 3, 1945.  We didn't disembark until about 2:00 am on June 4, 1945.  The only people on the dock were Red Cross workers offering drinks and donuts.  They didn't have many takers because the men had been stuffing themselves for 20 days.  The majority of the men couldn't button their shirts or pants because they had gained so much weight.  The average weight gain was about 50 pounds.  I weighed about 130 pounds when I got on the ship and 180 when I got off.  We arrived in Ft. Dix, NJ June 4, 1945.\r\n\r\nNext day got new clothes and was sent home on 90 day leave.\r\n\r\nI was glad to get home and see everyone, but I didn't seem to fit anymore.  After about a month I called Bill Newbold in Langhorne and he felt the same way.  I picked him up and we went to New York City for a couple of weeks.  I then went home and about 3rd week in August again called Bill and again he was ready to leave.  We took our time going to Miami Beach by way of Washington, DC and arrived at Miami Sept. 5, 1945 for two weeks R&R, We enjoyed Miami and stayed for about a month.  We then were transferred to Ellington Field, Houston, TX with a 3 week delay in-route.     We had a good time in New Orleans where we stayed for a week.  We arrived in Houston, TX sometime in October and attended Post Graduate Navigation School. In Houston I met Fritzi Daniel who became my wife in 1946.\r\n\r\nI left EllingtonField Feb. 16, 1946 and went to Sacramento, CA.  Bill and I stopped at every interesting spot between Houston and Sacramento.  Went to Juarez, Tuscon, Crater Nat'l Park, Painted Desert, Grand Canyon, Boulder Dam, Las Vegas, Death Valley, Sequoia Nat'l Park and Yosemite Nat'l Park.  We arrived at Sacramento about April 20, 1946 and were assigned to the Instrument Department but we did not have anything to do.\r\n\r\nI left Sacramento about April 26, 1946 and transferred to Las Vegas, NV.  Bill stayed in Sacramento.\r\n\r\nWhen I got to Las Vegas April 23, 1946.  I went to the base and there was no one there.  The place seemed deserted.  I went back to the base the next day and there were about two dozen Officers at the Officer's Club and I was informed we were to open some kind of school but no one knew what kind of school (typical Army).  In a few weeks I was sent to Kelly Field, San Antonio, TX.  to attend Administration School.  While at San Antonio, I would go to Houston on weekends and visit Fritzi.  We decided to get married.  We were married on June 29 in Ft. Worth, TX. which was also the day I graduated from Administration School.  We went back to San Antonio for about 4 weeks and then back to Las Vegas.  We stayed about a week in Las Vegas and then was transferred to Barksdale Field, Shreveport, LA.\r\n\r\nStayed in Shreveport about a week and was assigned to close Air Base at Ft. Myers, FL.  We went to Ft. Myers sometime in July and stayed until the middle of October.  I was Base Adjutant at Ft. Myers.\r\n\r\nWe went back to Barksdale Field and stayed a few weeks and requested separation from Active Duty.  Went home to Pittsburgh on leave and officially separated from the Service Jan. 12. 1947.",

    "bioArrivedFrom": "USA",
    "bioArrivedHow": "Flew to Halsworth.",
    "bioTripDetails": "When I first arrived in Great Britain, I was in the 389th BG at Halsworth.  I flew three missions with the crew with which I trained, but when the 389th went back to the USA in October 1944, my flight engineer, Charles Moffett and I, a radio operator were sent to the 44th BG and assigned to the 506th Sqdn.\r\n\r\nOur crew was made up of members who had ALL been in trouble at one time or another.  Nothing requiring a court martial, but we didn't warm their hearts.  Charles and I had three missions and Lou Confer, the pilot had about 16.  The rest of the crew all had different numbers.\r\n\r\nThe nose gunner was originally a flight engineer on his original crew.  When his pilot offered to beat up anyone on the crew, he took the dare and beat the Hell out of his pilot.  That was his story.  A waist gunner, who had been a ball gunner, one day when landing could not get out of his turret, so he fired his guns to let the pilot know!  \r\n\r\nThe tail gunner had a drinking problem, mainly because when he broke his ankle and missed a mission, his crew did not reutrn.  His second crew did not return when he again missed a mission with the flu.\r\n\r\nThe Navigator was a S/Sgt.  He had flunked out of Navigation School because he did not understand Celestial.  When he came over they made him our Navigator because no one used the \"Stars\",\r\n\r\nOur Pilot, Lou Confer, was a regular Army MP.  When he got his Wings, he was made a Flight Officer not a Second Lieutenant.  When Lou Confer finished his missions, we got Lt. Milt Parrish.  Milt was from Florida and had quite a drawl.  He once visited a friend and flew in a B-17.  When he returned, he said, \"Hell, all they did was to put 3 more engines on a Piper Cub!\"\r\n\r\nAfter 20 missions with the 506th, I'm happy to be in one piece and with all my marbles.\r\n\r\nMy Crew must have been different from every combat crew in the 44th BG.  Most of the people that tell me about their crews indicate they were the best in the 8th AF.  They seem to tell me that they never made a mistake and operated in a very professional manner.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, before each mission my pilot would determine the wind direction and speed.  Then he would say \"If we get shot down over the target, bail out and pull the rip cord as soon as possible so you will land a long way from the target\".  This statement failed to give us a great deal of confidence that we would be returning to England.\r\n\r\nOne morning a briefing officer accused us (all of the 44th) of dribbling bombs all over Europe.  He wouldn't even limit it to Germany.  My crew blew it on three occasions.  We dropped the bombs, but not at the target assigned-or any place that we could advise the de-briefing officer.  There was a different reason each time we erred.\r\n\r\nThe first time, the nose gunner toggled the bomb release before we got to the IP!  He had been sleeping and when someone on the intercom mentioned seeing a smoke bomb, it awoke him and he, without thinking, hit the toggle switch.  Of course, the smoke bomb was dropped by a group other than ours, and because the bomb bay doors were not open, the bombs went through them.  We stayed in formation, and while we were on the bomb run I spent my time trying to catch the flopping doors with a wire to stabilize them shut.  It is no easy task on that narrow cat walk.\r\n\r\nThe second time, we had problems with the aircraft.  We were unable to fly the mission in that plane.  We advised the tower and they assigned us another plane.  So off we went, taking off in a plane belonging to another squadron.  Again, before we reached the IP, the bombs went through the closed doors in the bomb bay.  This time the bombs were released by a radio receiver on our plane by a signal sent from a transmitter on the lead plane in that other Squadron!  Whoever it was that told us to change planes apparently was not aware that we had been briefed to bomb one target, while  the plane's receiver was set to the Squadron bombing a different target, long before we got ours.  Again, I spent the bomb run on the cat walk with the flopping doors, cussing anyone and everyone.\r\n\r\nThe third time was the real thrill.  We were loaded with a bunch of 100 pounders.  They all had yellow stripes around the nose that indicated they really did not need to be armed.  A good hit would set them off.  Rumors had it that a GI kicked one off the back of a truck and blew up an entire bomb dump!  As I remember it, the 100's were held by cables, four or more to a bundle, three bundles high and two deep on each side of the bomb bay.  I think there were 30  100 pounders on each side.\r\n\r\nIt was my job to see that the bombs were armed before they were dropped, I had to remove all the cotter keys from the arming devise which contained a small propeller.  I understood that when the propeller made 100 revolutions, it was armed and live.  We came to the IP and I opened the bomb bay doors, allowing the wind to come in and the little propellers started turning.  At the target and bombs away, the top two bundles of bombs let go, but the bottom bundle did not!  As a result, the ten higher bombs were loose and resting on top of the lowest bundle.  The side of the cat walk held the rest of them of them, not one bomb had dropped out or left the plane.  We closed the bomb bay doors to stop the wind from turning the propeller any more but we had no was of knowing how man  turns had already been taken. \r\n\r\nOur tail gunner, who had been to Armorer School, felt the safest thing to do was remove the arming devise by unscrewing it and carefully lifting the top bombs off while hoping it did not dislodge the others.  We would then carry the bomb to the open waist window and throw it out.  One by one the bombs were unarmed and carried back to the waist and tossed out the window.  None of the bombs dislodged the tail gunners plan worked.  Later when I asked if any of the bombs had exploded, when they hit, we discovered that no one had bothered to watch- or even look- because we were so intent on removing the danger from our plane. \r\n\r\nOur target for today (June 20, 1944) was the oil refineries of Politz, Germany.  They are always rougher than other targets.  It was a very long mission up over the North Sea, across Denmark (into the Baltic Sea), then turned south into Germany.  I could see the target through the smoke screen they had going, but the wind kept the smoke scattered.   Coming in on the IP we really caught very heavy and accurate flak.  I was sitting on the flight deck with the bomb bay doors open and saw a piece of flak hit the bombs.  Another piece knocked out the Put-put and also a piece hit my foot, but no damage.\r\n\r\nWhen bombs were away, I couldn't contact our Pilot, Herrmann.  The electrical system was out and I saw the bomb hung up and when the one above it dropped on it, it bounced to the outside of the bomb bay and hung up there with the tail fin wedged in the control cables.  I knew something was very wrong because we were going down, so I discarded my flak suit and parachute and went out on the catwalk.  I tried to lift the bomb out, but couldn't.  I got one foot on the outside of the bomb bay and stoop astraddle the open bomb bay and lifted the bomb out!  It seemed light - possibly because we were going down-making it lighter.  I very carefully dropped it out as I didn't know if the little propeller had turned off or not and I didn't want it to hit anything.  After getting the bomb bay doors shut, I went to the cockpit and told Joe (Herrmann) the bomb was out.  He said he knew something was wrong there but he had plenty to do just to keep the plane flying.  Dillon (Bombardier) later released the other bomb that did not release.  Joe told us later that the electrical system was out and we went down several thousand feet, out of control.  He had pressed the bailout button, but nothing happened.  About then the engines caught again and Joe got the plane under control.  At the same time this was happening Lyle Latimer (tail gunner) was throwing lead at a ME410 which was attacking us.  The group behing us was hit hard by fighters (492nd BG lost 14 planes).   Joe said he was going to put me in for the Silver Star but we never heard anything from it.\r\n\r\nAfter all these years, there is very little I remember about most of the missions I flew.  There is, of course, one exception.  One mission that seems like yesterday had, as I recall, almost everything that could happen.  \r\n\r\nIt started out with the briefing officer stressing that the target HAD to be visual as it was in German-occupied Denmark.  \"You are not to bomb through clouds or fog or smoke.  You must be able to see the target.  Under no circumstances do we want you to harm or hurt any of the Danish people! The people of Denmark are our friends, and we must take great care to protect them.\"  He continued, \"If you cannot drop the bombs at the target, there is a designated area in the North Sea to unload.  We do not want you to attempt a landing with the bombs on board.\"\r\n\r\nThe mission seemed simple, some would call it a milkrun.  To me the worst part was the coming and going.  It was over the North Sea where I always felt uneasy, flying over water in a B-24.  The plane was not known as a great plane for ditching.  There was also the rumor that the North Sea was so cold that a downed flyer could not last longer than about 20 minutes, even on the warmest day of summer.  As a radio operator, I had a special job on this mission.  I was to monitor the SOS frequency #500 \r\n and do anything I could to assist a plane in trouble.  At the proper time, we took off, formed and headed for the target.  Once we were over the North sea, I switched on the #500 frequency to listen for any SOS.  I expected to hear Morse Code and it surprised me when I heard a voice tht had to be German calling \"Achtung Luftwaffe\" over and over.\r\n\r\nI thought, \"Oh Hell, they know we're coming and we are going to have enemy fighter for the whole mission\".  I related my fears to the crew and told them to keep a sharp lookout for enemy fighters.  We flew at least three hours to get to the target in Denmark, and every few minutes this same German voice would call for \"Achtung Luftwaffe\" over and over.  And each time  imagined we were going to go down in that cold, cold, cold, North Sea.  I begged those gunners to keep their eyes open.\r\n\r\nI activated the bombs by removing the cotter keys long before the target.  I wanted to make sure we could get out of there as fast as possible, if necessary.\r\n\r\nWhen we got to the target, it was not visible just 100% cloud coverage.  I had hoped we would get out of there as soon as possible, but NO the leader was hoping the clouds might go away, so we flew around for awhile, waiting for the target to become visible.  I figured this would be my last mission, if the Luftwaffe didn't get me, we would run out of gas and that icy water would do the job.  Eventually, we headed back to the base and arrived at the place we were to drop our bombs into the sea.  I was exhausted from fear; fear of non-existant enemy fighters, and fear of the cold sea.  I did not replace the cotter keys in the bombs, so that when they hit, they must have given a real thrill to a lot of fish.\r\n\r\nAt the debriefing, I told the officer about the Luftwaffe calls and the fears they brought to me.  He then put the knife in and turned it good.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry, Gentlemen,\" he said, \"Because there was no enemy action, flak or planes, this cannot be counted as a combat mission and you do not get any credit for your tour.  Some days were like that!\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I spent six hours experiencing all sorts of fears of enemy action, etc. And that brings to mind FDR's warning about fear, but it did not occur to me at any time during those six hours.",

    "bioTripDetails": "The tragedy of war reached him early while he was still training in this country.  Eight men with whom he had worked during numerous training flights and had come to regard as \"my crew\", were all killed when their plane crashed in New Mexico during a routine flight.  A ninth man who perished in the flight had replaced him at the last minute at the request of the pilot.  The pilot had wanted his own engineer.  A few weeks later he was assigned a new crew and they flew the Southern Route to England.\r\n\r\nServing as a Flight Engineer aboard a B-24 flew thirteen missions over Europe. During these daylight raids over Germany, France and Austria he watched 2 of his second team die on these missions as a result of enemy flak and fighter plane bullets.  A tail gunner and a waist gunner died with their guns blazing.\r\n\r\nOn one of the missions, from his gun turret atop the plane, he watched enemy flak and bullets smash into the plane's hydraulic landing gear assembly and two of its motors.  As the plane limped back back towards its base, two of motors coughed and sputtered, belching flames. Flak holes lined the wings and fuselage of the plane, and a jagged hole replaced the landing assembly.  The battered condition of the plane made further flight impossible.  The pilot, Lt. Carpenter, guided the plane towards and English field in the heart of Africa, where they crash landed.  Most of the crew escaped with minor injuries.\r\n\r\nThe most serious of the three crashes he experienced occurred as the result of enemy action was the first low altitude bombing raid on the Ploesti oil fields in Roumania.  He recalled \"The raid was the first low level bonbing mission of the war, and we all knew it would be plenty tough.  We knew that flying 150 feet over our target with scores of ground installations blasting away at us promised to be a red-hot ride.  The chance that we would miss our target at that altitude was slight but the chance the enemy guns would miss us was just as slight.  We threw our full load at our target with the plane bouncing like a bronco from the concussion of the flak.  We hung on and prayed and the words \"target hit\" was sweet music.  Out of the flak zone it was pretty obvious that our plane was in bad shape.  Two of the engines had been shot out and the 3rd was missing badly.  We lost one waist gunner.  He had been hit with a with a 20 mm shell.\r\n\r\nThe top turret, which was my 'office' had been shot completely away.  The back of my head was numb and I knew I had been hit by something.  Physicians in an African Hospital three days later removed 32 pieces of flak form the back of my head.\r\n\r\nWe were still 300 miles from the African base when the third motor conked out, we crashed in the Sea. The plane was completely demolished.  All of the crew escaped but three.  We kept afloat with rubber life belts and managed to salvage a rubber raft and inflated it.  The seven survivors drifted three days and nights in extremely rough water before they were picked by the Air Sea Rescue division of the RAF.  The rescue party responded to an SOS call sent out by the radio engineer before the crash.\r\n\r\nThe remaining members of his crew were removed to an African hospital where they learned they had been reported \"missing in action.\"  My left side was paratially paralyzed and I suffered amnesia for four days.  I remained in the hospital for several weeks and returned to England where I engaged in four more missions over occupied Europe bringing his total missions to 24.\r\n\r\nOn this 24th mission I suffered complete paralysis of the left side and was removed to an English field hospital where he was treated for six months.  He was returned to Mitchel Field, NY again to be hospitalized for another month.  He was removed to a rest hospital at Coral Gables, FL and was given final treatment and a medical discharge.",

    "bioTripDetails": "Lt. Col. Robert J. Lehnhausen hesitates to mention It, but before he flew on B-24's, he had been assigned to B-17's. In a world of 'Liberator-lovers' he rarely admits that he liked them. He volunteered for pilot training to avoid a dead-end assignment in the Coast Artillery. Drafted in Peoria, Illinois at age 21, Lehnhausen was working in the Regimental Post Office. His Adjutant, a West Pointer, took him aside one day and gave him a piece of advice, \"If you want to get ahead in the service, go elsewhere.\" \r\n\r\nAccepting this advice, he responded to an Aviation Cadet Recruiting Team. Since he was not a college graduate, he began a series of academic and physical tests at Ft. Bragg, N.C. He qualifled, but began an uneasy wait for assignment. Pearl Harbor called the 40th Army Unit to be transferred from North Carolina to Camp MAAR on California's Mojave Desert. The would-be aviator's heart sank, believing that move would close the door on flight school. \r\n\r\nTo his surprise, after twelve days of desert duty, orders caught up with him, and his Air Corps odyssey began. He was assigned to a newly opened Aviation Cadet Reception Center at William Fleld, Chandler, Arizon.  After a few weeks of ground school, foot drill and calisthenics, he began the three phase program of pilot training, completing the program in August, 1942. With pride and delight, he received his pilot status as a Second Lieutenant. \r\n\r\nOf Lehuhausen's class at Roswell, most were sent for further training on four engine planes. Bob went to Geiger Field, WA (Spokane) to train on B-17's. After a few weeks of Intense training, he was assigned a crew. Together they went to a new base in Casper, Wyoming. They were among the first troops In Casper, a cause for great excitement in the town. \"They really rolled out the 'red carpet' for us,\" he remembered. \r\n\r\nCrew training for eventual combat went very well, he recalled. Upon completion of this phase. they went to Salina, Kansas and were issued a brand new B-17, outfitted with all gear needed for combat. Then they were ready for the trip to a combat unit. \r\n\r\n\"We went the southern route, down to South America, east to Ascension Island, then to Africa and finally to England,\" he remembered. \"Ascension Island was a fifteen square mile volcanic eruption in the south Atlantic. Peterson our navigator, told us to hold the course, and we would find it. We nissed it by only 1/4 mile. \r\n\r\n\"We went into orientation at Bovingdon, England with 34 other B-17 crews. Members of the RAF taught us how to deal with anti-aircraft and RAF radio procedures, also basic courtesies, so we could get along with the English people. Then General Longfellow sent the word that seven crews would have to go to B-24's. The Colonel pulled seven numbers from his hat, and I was one. I felt like I was being wrenched from the graceful 'Queen of the Sky,' but in time I learned to love the Liberator.\" \r\n\r\n\"At this time, March 1943, the Eighth Air Force had only five bomb groups. The two B-24 units active were the 44th and the 93rd. These seven crews being  assigned were the first replacement crews. Five of us went to the 44th, two to the 93rd. Of the five assigned to the 44th, two went to the 66th, one to the 67th, and two of us went to the 68th. We were greeted warmly by a very weary bunch of combat airmen. \r\n\r\n\"At that point our crews were broken up. This permitted two of the Squadrons' original co- pilots to become first pilots. Four of my crew joined Wilmer Garrett the rest went with Bill Hughes. In late June, 1943 after several weeks of practice in low level over the Mounds of East Anglia, we were ordered to join the Ninth Air Force on the Libyan Desert of North Africa. We were dispatched there to prepare for and to fly a special mission, so secret, the troops were unaware of what would be the target. Ninth Air Force's two B-24 groups had been bombing targets supportive of the upcoming Sicilian invasion.\" \r\n\r\nUpon arrival on the desert, the Ninth Air Force immediately assigned the three B-24 units from the Eighth Air Force to the pre-invasion attack effort. \r\n\r\nLehnhausen continued, \"Our first mission from our new base at Benina Main, which we shared with Ninth's 98th Bomb Group, was on July 2, 1943. The target was a German-held airfield at Lecce, Italy, a base in the heel of the Italian boot.  Although the nission was relatively free of enemy opposition, it proved to be fateful for Major Tom Cramer, Squadron Commander. He had chosen to fly as co-pilot with a new crew, and the plane went down. \r\n\r\nI was co-pilot for Wilmer Garrett in Miss Virginia. We did have an attack by enemy aircraft in the target area. Our gunners exchanged fire with the attackers, and we believed our ship was not badly damaged. \r\n\r\n\"We dropped our bombs on target and headed to home base. On the return it became apparent that some damage had occurred to our fuel system. We were running out of petrol. We prepared for ditching, throwing everything that was mobile overboard to lighten the aircraft to no avail. We ditched into the Mediterranean. The B-24 did not have good ditching characteristics. The ship broke into three major pieces upon impact with the water. The pilot and I were both thrown through the windshield. I surfaced alongside the wing/fuselage junction. Fortunately, two dinghys stored in the upper fuselage were within arm's reach. We released them, scrambled into them and picked up all the survivors who surfaced. Of a crew of eleven, six of us survived. \r\n\r\nTraining and understanding emergency procedures always pays off. In this tragic combat action, our radio operator, John Melvin Cole, did precisely what he had been trained to do in a ditching procedure. Upon being told to \"Prepare for Ditching,\" he sent out the Morse Code SOS; and after several signals, screwed down his key to send a continuous signal. His action saved all who survived the crash. \r\n\r\n\"After several hours in the water, a vessel appeared on the horizon. We were so excited!  A few minutes later we looked again. There was no vessel. In frustration, one of our crew ordered 'Let's paddle.' This brought a laugh. We had two small dinghys lashed together, four injured crewmen, two small paddles, an unconscious navigator; and we were at least one hundred miles off the desert coast. Paddle! To where? \r\n\r\n\"Sometime later the vessel reappeared. It came closer and closer, but its course was taking it about twenty degrees from us. The sea was calm, but the morning was very hazy. Finally I fired two flares, and the bow of the ship swung around as if I had it on a string. Then that vessel grew larger and larger. At that point our vocal crewman let out an expletive and shouted, \"we get dumped in the Mediterranean, we survive, they find us, and now the SOB runs over us!\"\r\n\r\n\"We were rescued by a British mine layer who was on a special mission, transporting the British Army General Staff from Alexandria, Egypt to Malta in advance of the Sicilian invasion. They had picked up Cole's radio transmission, and began a square search for us - lucky for us, for there was no air/sea rescue unit in that area at that time.\r\n\r\n\"We were taken to Malta where we spent five days in a British General Hospital. Then, in preparation for the upcoming invasion, the hospital was evacuated. We were sent to an American Field Hospital in Tripoli. Five days later the radio operator, John Cole; our engineer, Ed Waite and I were ambulatory, so we were sent back to our Squadron. The three who were more seriously injured were sent to an American General Hospital in Cairo.  \r\n\r\n\"Back at base our new CO, John Diehl told us he wanted us to go on leave, relax, enjoy. We caught a plane to Cairo. After seeing the local sights, we appealed to the Cairo based Red Cross lady for suggestions. She encouraged us to take the British Army's train from Cairo to Palestine (Tel Aviv) and see the Holy Land. It departed each evening at 5:30, traveled the desert in the cool of night and arrived in Jaffa at 6:00 A.M. \r\n\r\n\"I purchased the tickets for the three of us. We were comfortably seated in the Lawrence of Arabia narrow wooden train compartment. Some time after leaving Cairo, a British master sergeant who was the train conductor, entered our compartment to collect the tickets. He was aghast. Two Yank enlisted men in first class seats!  We had a spirited conversation. He demanded that Cole and Waite go to Third Class where enlisted personnel ride. \r\n\r\n\"Finally I said, 'Sergeant, you have a problem. Your people sold me these tickets for First Class Passage. Either these two men remain with me or we all ride Third Class.' In disgust he yielded. He couldn't tolerate an officer riding Third Class.\" \r\n\r\nThe trip to the Holy Land proved to be educational, enlightening and inexpensive. A three-day guided bus trip, two nights lodging and all food cost only two British pounds. ($8 U.S.) \r\n\r\nThey arrived back at the Squadron on the Thursday before Ploesti. Lehnhausen was asked to fly the low level Ploesti mission as co-pilot for Eunice Shannon. Ploesti was an awesome experience, an unbelievable panorama of planes, gunfire, explosions and destruction. We saw planes going down around us, flak buffeted us mercilessly; but by the grace of God, our aircraft was unscathed. \r\n\r\nThe next mission our group flew following Ploesti was to Wiener-Neustadt, August 13, 1943, our target, an aircraft manufacturing facility. The target was beyond our range, so to make the attack possible, we were briefed to land on bases in Tunis, rather than to attempt returning to Libya. It was my first mission as pilot. I was elated, but my crew was a new crew on their first ndssion, and their pilot had to move over to the co-pilot's seat. I wasn't a popular pilot on this mission, but fortunately, it was an easy one, little opposition-no fighters. However, our fuel transfer system fouled up, and we had to make a difficult landing on a bombed out fighter base in Sicily. Happily, we made it back safely to our base.\r\n\r\nDays later we headed back to Shipdham for a mere three weeks, and then back to North Africa, joining the 99th Bomb Group (B-17's) in Tunisia. We flew only a few missions, as the rainy season had moved in. On October 1, 1943 they sent us back to Wiener-Noustadt. This time the Germans were ready for us. This was the worst nightmare of any mission I had ever experienced, and it was one of the group's most costly. On the return, I looked out to our left. Dick Butler was sitting out there all alone. Sometime later I asked why he was alone.  His response was that all other ships in his formation had been shot down.\r\n\r\nShortly after this difficult mission we were again ordered back to England. By now Willie Weant my original co-pilot, Dave Alexander (a B- 17 transfer) and I were the most senior pilots in the Squadron. \r\n\r\nWe had a pause at that time. The weather was bad. We had sustained high losses, and new ideas were being formulated. Most helpful was the arrival of the P-51. Those daredevil flyers accompanied us on missions, going after the Luftwaffe with unbelievable zeal, strafing planes on the ground and shooting them in the air. They were truly our 'little friends.' \r\n\r\nLate in December, George Hulpiau, my original bombardier; Bob Peterson, my original Navigator, and I got back together as a crew. We flew three missions together, all Group Leads. On Dec. 31, 1943, we had a Wing Lead, with Col. Bill Cameron as our Command Pilot, to an airfield in southwestern France, St. Jean D'- Angly. Flying with men of such superior skills was exhilarating. \r\n\r\nBy this time I had completed my 35 missions. Shortly after the January 11, 1944 mission, I was transferred to operations in Group Headquarters as a Briefing Officer. The balance of my combat missions were flown as a Command Pilot, standing on the flight deck between the pilots. \r\n\r\nEarly April, CoL Gibson gave me the opportunity of a lifetime. He made me Commander of my old \r\nSquadron, the 68th. I held that position from April, 1944 until we came home in late May, 1945. \r\n\r\n'Being C.O. was a great honor and a tremendous experience. Many of these moments were truly enjoyable; equally many were sad. We lost many, many isplandid young patriots. Among them was my only brother Edward ('Doc'), who with his crew, joined our Squadron in mid July 1944. This was only after permission was granted by higher headquarters. 'Doc' was a good pilot.  We had a clear understanding of how we must handle our relationship, and we carefully observed this.  As it happened, a German anti-aircraft battery chose his plane to target; he and his entire crew were lost on October 18,1944 on a mission to Leverkusen, Germany. \r\n\r\n\"Along with 35,000 other 8th and 15th Air Force members, I was sent to Sioux Falls, South Dakota. I had 30 days home leave, and was awaiting reassignment to a B-29 training unit in preparation for the assault on Japan. And then the war ended. \r\n\r\n\"Sioux Falls became a Separation Center. I was given the task of presiding at final ceremonies. Twice a day we processed about 200 veterans, thanked them for their service, gave them their separation documents and saluted each, individually. To me, it was a great honor to thank and salute these young men who had expended their youth and vitality, serving until victory was won.\" \r\n\r\nThe population of the base continued to shrink. When Lehnhausen departed for his separation on December 22, 1945, only 125 military personnel remained on base.  \r\n\r\nHe went back to Peoria and his sporting goods sales job.  After several weeks, he joined his father in his retail drapery business. Before long his leadership skills reached into the civic and political life of Peoria. Together, with other returning veterans and interested community leaders, they changed our local government, all for the better. Their war experience taught them that if they were old enough and smart enough to win a war, they were old and smart enough to govern their hometown.  \r\n\r\nLehnhausen and his wife Elizabeth energized Peoria, intending that their seven children would be raised in a desirable, secure environment. He served as a member of the Peoria City Council \r\nfor fourteen years, the last four as mayor (1965- 69). Later he was honored to serve in the Cabinet of the Governor of Illinois. This 39 months was an enlightening governmental stint. From there he was invited into the banking world. He retired in 1985 having served as Vice President/ Treasurer of First Federal Savings of Peoria for 12-1/2 years. He has been a member of the present Board of the 44th BGVA since its reorganization, six years ago.",

Came home 5 times with flak damage - Once with 20 mm holes - 1 flak hole was in windshield in front of my face.\r\n\r\nMost terrifying experience was flying over from Goose Bay to Reykjavik, at night on instrument, in heavy icing.  One vacuum pump quit, directional gyro started spinning, fortunately other vacuum pump worked and enough coast remained on other instruments to stay upright.\r\n\r\nMost terrifying sight over Politz, Germany, June 20, 1944, when 50 German fighters abreast, passed directly in front of us, and dove down on the 492nd BG flying low left of us and shot down a whole box of 12 aircraft.\r\n\r\nA heart-stopping experience during my 4 days of escape.  I was lying in a creek bed under low-lying branches, when a tiger tank crew started cutting branches above my head to camouflage their tank 150 feet down the road.  (They did not cut down far enough).\r\n\r\n3rd mission - on take off with full bomb load my Co-Pilot, thinking we were off the ground, stepped on the brakes to stop the wheel rotation to raise the landing gear.  I pulled throttles off, but seeing we could not stop - back on.  Thought we had just missed a tower at the end of the runway.  Found out on return we had knocked a ball off the top.  \r\n\r\n13th mission - aborted mission twice before we made it, but blew a tire stopping on return on short runway. \r\n\r\n31st mission - a lost mission.  Stupid mission - 3-road intersections  lined up on long bomb run to drop 1/3 load on each - perfect for enemy AA - got us on 1st bursts setting #1 and #2 engines on fire.  We all bailed out and survived.  My crew were all POWs to war end.  I escaped and got back in friendly lines in 4 days.",

    "bioArrivedHow": "Flew with crew in a new B-24 over Northern Route to final destination Shipdham RAF Station near Norwich, Eng.",
    "bioTripDetails": "We flew a new B24D over Northern Route to final destination Shipdham RAF station near Norwich, England. Here we were assigned a war weary B24D and sent to join the 66th Bomb Sqd. of the 44th BG in Benghazi, Libya. We participated in a number of missions in England and Africa until 1 October '43.  On our 8th mission, we were shot down over Weiner Neustadt.  I, along with the remaining crew members still alive, bailed out. I landed in the foothills of the Alps and evaded three days, until I was captured. Spent 19 months in Stalag Luft and Stalag 7A until liberated April 29, 1945.\r\n\r\nThe Weiner Neustadt mission was very stressful. We managed to drop our bombs on target but took many hits from both A/A and Fighter aircraft weapons. We could not keep up with the group and were isolated and out of formation, left to the mercy of fighter aircraft. Four ME109's made a sweep through the group from 12 O'clock. We sustained a couple of hits but nothing serious. Then we received a burst of flak in our #2 engine, completely disabling it and at practically the same time had a portion of our left rudder shot away leaving us with aileron control only. After dropping our bombs the rest of the group turned SSW but we were unable to turn with them and what appeared to be about 18 or 20 ME 109's concentrated on us. In the ensuring fight our top turret became inoperative, our right waist gunner was killed.  We received direct 20 mm hits in our bomb bay gas tanks, thus setting it on fire, #3 engine was shot out, #1 engine received hits and was losing oil. Our left Waist Gunner shot down 1 ME 109, Tail Gunner shot down 1 ME 109, Bombardier 2 ME 109's and I shot down 2 ME 109's making a total of 6 enemy planes shot down by the crew. \r\n\r\nThe Pilot gave orders over the inter-phone to bail out, then he rang the emergency bell. I opened the nose wheel door and went out feet first, after counting to ten I pulled the rip cord. The chute opened with a violent jerk and then all was silent. While floating down 2-ME 109's circled close and pilots saluted and departed. I had bailed out at about 17,000 ft and hit the ground through a stand of small pine trees in the foothills of the Alps. I immediately hid my chute, harness and Mae West and crawled through the underbrush until I found a good hiding place where I remained until dark. I started walking South hoping to reach Yugoslovia and the partisians. It was mountainous country and progress was slow.  Early on the morning of Oct. 2, 1943 I stopped and rested for a few hours and started out again. I walked all day and finally about 1700 found that I was approaching a small village.  I hadn't been able to find any food and was very hungry. I reconnoitered from the side of a hill and found a house a couple of miles out of town and decided to try to get something to eat and leave before the people in the house could get into town to turn me in. \r\n\r\nThe people, a farm family, were decent enough to me and gave me some food, but while I was eating it a young man went to town on a bicylee and got the local police who came out on motorcycles. They walked in with rifles and when I had finished eating, serched me taking my 45, a sheath knife, compasses, etc. They took me into the town which was Aspang, Austria. I stayed there until about 2100 and was then taken to Neunkirohen, Austria on a motorcycle and lodged in the local jail.  About 0500 on the morning of 3 Oct. 1943 a Luftwaffe officer took me by train to Weiner-Neustadt and turned me over to the Luftwaffe on the field we had bombed. There I met my co- pilot, bombardier and 3 enlisted men. They told me 3 enlisted men on the crew had been killed before they could bail out and the pilot hadn't been found. \r\n\r\nWe stayed at Weiner-Neustady until the morning of 6 Oct. 1943 then taken by train to Frankfurt-am-Main and from there to the interrogation center at Oberusel.  We stayed there until the 12th of Oct. 1943, then taken by box-car to Sagan, Nieder Silesia, Germany, Stalag Luft III, where we arrived on 17 Oct. 1943. \r\n\r\nWhile at Luft III, I was block Publications Officer and OIC of the typing pool for the compound news room.\r\n\r\nI feel sure that if I had remained with my group I would have been promoted at least to the grade of Captain by this time and would have been the Squadron Navigator by the end of 1943.  At the time I was shot down we had no regular Squadron Navigator and I was second in line for the job.  The man who was first in line was sent to a PFF Group, which would have given me the job.\r\n\r\nI was in the class of 43-5 which graduated 10 April 1943 and most of my class mates about whom I have made inquiries have been in the grade of Captain for some time.  Some of them are Capt. Frank Sneff, Capt. J. B. Smith, Capt. William McShane and Capt. Joseph Lemming.\r\n\r\nI had led the Squadron a couple of times and had worked with Capt. Sturnberger in preparing Group Breifings while flying out of North Africa.",

We then returned to England and flew a few missions there, again we returned to Tunis, North Africa for more missions.  Returned to England and was shot down over Bremen, Germany 12/20/43.\r\n\r\nThe worst mission I flew was on December 20, 1943 when we were shot down over Bremen, Germany.  We lost the Supercharger on the bomb run.  We had to drop out of formation and was hit by German fighters.  We continued on to target and I bombed target by myself and crew who were badly shot up.  Flak took its toll on us over the target and more of the crew were hit.  Upon leaving the target, the fighters picked us up again.  We fought a running battle to Willhelmshaven with the Fighters.  The plane was going down, it was very hard to control.  Gunnel, the Co-Pilot, and I took all our strength to hold the B-24 in the air.  The plane was shot full of holes, we managed to get five miles over the North Sea and decided we did not have enough gas to continue to England.  We turned around and went back to Germany.  The German Fighters were waiting for us and again we fought a running battle, until I gave the bail-out signal.  Two men were killed and the rest of the crew managed to bail out.  Lt. Gray and Sgt. Aho landed in the water.  Sgt. Aho was never heard from again, presumed KIA.  The rest of the crew were taken POW and returned to the United States after the war.\r\n\r\nWhile a prisoner in Germany tried to escape and was caught.  Germans were waiting outside the fence and would have shot us if we had gone through the fence.  While still a POW a big Russian Cossack wanted my watch.  We argued about it, he finally took his gun and shot into the floor between my feet and then shot into the ceiling, I said \"okey, here's my watch!!\"  We were liberated by the Russians in 1945.\r\n\r\nMy 2nd worst mission was my 1st mission with Lt. Stevens to Foggia, Italy.  On a mission to Norway we tried to bomb a German Ship on the way back to England.  We had two bombs left.  Missed the ship and hit on each side of it.\r\n\r\nFlew combat missions over Korea in 1953 while stationed at Tachi-Kawa AFB, Japan.",

    "bioTripDetails": "I was an Aerial Gunner on  Lt. C. Spagnola's crew, we flew a new Ford manufactured B- 24J #50695 from Topeka, Kas (July 18, 1944) and flew to Grenier Fld, NH (9. 1 5 hrs. flying time). Departed Grenier Fid. on July 19,1944 and flew to Goose Bay, Labrador (5.4 hrs). Departed Goose Bay July 20, 1944 for Meeks Fld, Reykjavik, Iceland (9.30 hrs). Departed Meek Fld, Iceland on July 21, 1944 and arrived at Valley Fld, Holy Head, North Wales on July 22,1944.\r\n\r\nMy combat tour in the 2nd Air Division of the 8th Air Force was certainly an interesting part of my life. Our bomber crew (Spagnola-Pilot) arived at the 44th Bomb Group Base at Shipdham, England on 8/11/1944. It happened to be the day the 44th Bomb Group was having a celebration of their 200th combat mission only we didn't know it at the time. No one was wearing any rank or insignia and people were drinking beer and partying all over the field. A bunch of men chased two people, grabbed them and then threw them in a pond with their clothes on. I asked what's going on? They said they just threw the General, CO of the 14th Combat Wing and Colonel, CO of the 44th Bomb Group into the water I thought to myself what kind of a crazy outfit have I been assigned to. Although my assignment to the 44th Bomb Group started out in a very strange manner it turned out to be a great outfit and a great experience for me. \r\n\r\nI flew my Ist combat mission on 8/26/44 and my last mission on 2/28/45. No flak or enemy fighters were encountered on either of these missions. However, this was definitely not the norm for bombing missions over Germany in 1944 and 1945. On a bombing mission to Cologne on 10/17/44 we were being hit repeatedly with heavy and accurate flak when the co-pilot yelled there goes a B-24 down in flames at 11 o'clock. I stuck my head out the waist window to look and off went my steel helmet down into the heart of Cologne. A very bad time to lose head protection. \r\n\r\nAnother interesting mission was on 2/22/45 when 6000 aircraft from the RAF, 8th Air Force, 9th Air Force and 15th Air Force bombed all over Germany. There were so many aircraft trying to form up into the bomber stream that every time we crossed over another group's prop wash we were shook violently and our bombs would flap up and down in the bomb bay. Very scary. Another concern on this mission was that we bombed from an altitude of 6000 ft. and could feel the concussion from our exploding bombs. Fortunately, enemy resistance in our target area (Gottingen) was light and all 44th Group aircraft returned safely to base. \r\n\r\nI flew 30 missions with my original crew. (Spagnola pilot). I flew first on 8/26/44 as tail gunner and the rest as right wasit gunner. I was originally the Sperry Ball turret gunner on the Spagnola Crew and lost my position on the crew because all ball turrets had been removed from the Sth Air Force B-24's in early 1944. 1 rejoined my crew on 9/22/44 because Pondfield was wounded in the leg by flak on their previous mission. \r\n\r\nI was 5 missions behind when my regular crew (Spagnola Pilot) finished their tour and had to complete my tour with other crews. I flew 2 missions with Bethel's crew whose Navigator was Will Abrams. Back in Belle Harbor, NY where I grew up I was a Boy Scout in Troop 81 and Will Abrams was my Scout Master! I flew my last mission on 2/28/45 with Crandell's crew all of whom were killed on a low level mission on 3/2/45. \r\n\r\nOf the 30 missions, I flew with my original crew, 16 of them were in a B24H Serial #42- 95087 originally A bar but later changed to K bar. The Maintenance Crew Chief on this aircraft was T/Sgt Chowanski. This aircraft was well maintained and flew a record 97 missions without an abort. On one occasion we flew to 33,000 ft to get over clouds, something your average B-24 can't do. K bar finished with over 120 missions and was returned to the States after the war. T/Sgt Chowanski's original aircraft L'il Cookie survived all it's combat missions and was eventually turned into an assembly ship. He never lost a ship or crew the whole time he was a crew chief, some record!! \r\n\r\nAfter completing combat tour was assigned as an NV for a few weeks in March 1945 until returned home.",

The significant exception was the Ploesti Low Level Raid mentioned in Special Status.  I was a POW in Romania from August 1, 1943 to  August 23, 1944 when Romania capitulated to the Allied Powers.  All American POWs from the Low Lever Ploesti Raid were given excellent treatment, including medical.  It was said that the Low Level attack spared their civilians, schools,etc.  POWs from later High Altitude Missions (starting in  April 1940) were held in a separate camp in Buchafest.  Our Camp was located in a pass through the Transalvania Alps, was called Tinis De Jos.  The Swiss Delegation, which made periodical visits to check compliance with International Rules on Treatment of POWs, called our Camp \"The Country Club of Europe\" (in comparison with other POW camps).  We were paid the same salary as  Romanians of equal rank - not cash but credit in special accounts.  We could make weekly purchases from a nearby town (Brason).  We had weeky religious services.  Complete clothing (coats, shirts, etc.) came in packages from the  Red Cross.\r\n\r\nAlthough credited with 12 missions, I have some doubts about Lecce, Italy (mission #33) and Gerebcana, Sicily (mission # 35).  On my first mission (Bordeaux, France), Capt. Bill Bransdon,        experience, flew my plane as pilot, while I served as co-pilot.

I was in the 3rd Class \"C\" at OCS in Miami Beach and on August 5, 1942 was on my way to Will Rogers Field to join the 44th.

    "bioTripDetails": "Acting as Squadron Navigator there are three very memorable combat missions that I remember.\r\n\r\nOn September 11, 1944, Air Crew #5128 was commanded by first pilot 2d Lt. C. (Chris) Spagnola and composed of 2d Lt. Robert J. Keyes, Co-Pilot  -  2d Lt. Robert Lee Aston, Navigator  -   2d Lt. Curt Silverthorne, Bombardier  -   Cpl. Harry Selkirk, Radio Operator  -   Cpl. Thomas Currie, Flight Engineer  -   Cpl. George Chigaris, Wasit Gunner  -   Cpl. John Gately, Turret Gunner  -   Cpl. Norman Sutherland, Tail Gunner  -   Cpl. John Pondfield, Waist Gunner.  Memory fails me, but I believe Cpl. Chigaris was absent on this mission. We had a \"mickey\" operator (radar jammer) along on our B-24, Bar S (2110030) on this mission.\r\n\r\nThe mission was number 5 for Spadnola's crew. The target, an ordinance plant at Hannover, Germany. The route in took us south of the German-held pockets along the French-Belgian coast. Enroute, at Koblenz, we picked up accurate, heavy flak that shot out our hydraulic system severing lines near the navigator's station. Starboard waist gunner Cpl. John Pondfield was wounded in one leg - no broken bone. His wound was tended to by the other waist gunner, probably John Gately. Before reaching the I.P., the waist gunner and engineer, Currie, had to hand crank the bomb bay doors open. The forward bay doors opened, but the back bay doors were frozen closed. The door linkage was pulled so that the doors would break and fall away when the bombs were released through them. Bombing altitude was 23,000 feet. The target being cloud-covered, we dropped eight 1,000 lb. bombs by PFF.  \"Bombs away\" at 12.36.  The rear bay doors failed to break free and fall away, hanging on and creating a shuddering vibration throughout the ship, and flapping for the rest of the flight, making flying more difficult for the pilots. Flak at Hannover was intense and peppered Bar S.  Gunner Sutherland's electrical system was shot out in his tail turret. \r\n\r\nOn return to Shipdham, landing was tricky as we had no brakes, just a one-shot application of the brakes using remaining fluid in the reservoir, and after that one time, the pressure was gone.  Lt. Spagnola ordered all crew to the rear of the aircraft to weight the tail for drag, and to let two parachutes out the waist windows for more drag.  Lt. Spadnola's worst fear was that sparks from the flapping bomb bay doors on the runway might cause sparking and ignite the gasoline that was leaking and explode the aircraft. The parachute drag worked and running off the runway on to the turf reducing both sparking of the flapping doors plus helping to slow our roll to a stop before we ran out of landing field. Mission flight time was 6.75 hours. Except for Pondfield, we all lived to fly another day of combat. \r\n\r\nOn mission No. 16, October 30, 1944, the target was an oil refinery and tank field at Hamburg. The weather was terrible and forming up for the 44th Group was near impossible. Those that had already formed had to break up. The cloud formations were so high and thick we could not find our group again.  Lt. Spadnola decided to fly the routing and see if we could find the group and wing enroute. By the time we reached the Dutch coast we still had not found our wing or any formation of B-24's. We had seen formations of B-17's but decided not to go along with them.  Lt. Spagnola asked me if I could take us into the target by ourselves.  \"Roger!  Wilco!\"  We went on the planned course to the IP and target, dodging through towering clouds at 25,000 feet and bombed the target alone.  As we came out of the target area, the clouds began to dissipate over the Northe Sea coast and we had several other stray B-24's from other groups tack on to our wing and follow us.  Before leaving the Hamburg coast we encountered accurate flak.  One of the stranger's ships flying off our wing exploded after taking a direct hit.  Two others of the tag-a-longs were hit and went down in flames. As we went along we picked up a few more straggler B-24's from other groups, but none from the 44th B.G.  We wound up with about 12 B-24's following us and leading them back to England.  Mission flight time 6.25 hours. \r\n\r\nOn January 5, 1945, 1st Lt. Spagnola and crew flew mission #30 to bomb a rail marshalling yard at Pirmasens in the Rhineland.  Assembly for the 44th B. G. was over Splasher 12, West of London at 18,000 feet.  We never found our group, so we flew on to the I.P. alone.  Seeing no sign of the 44th, we fell in with the 448th B.G. and bombed the same target as intended.  Just after \"bombs away\" we suffered a hit and trouble with number 2 engine.  Lt. Spagnola cut off #2 and feathered the prop. With only three engines running, we could not keep up with the B-24 formation's airspeed so we left the 448th B.G. around Saarbrucken and headed for Ostend, Belgium, on our own. Along the way we fell in behind a B-17 group which we could keep up with on three engines.  We were slowly losing some altitude and cut away from the B-17's.  We had good ground visibility and since France was in Allied control we were not worried about flak.  By the time we reached the coast in the Ostend-Dunkirk-Calais area we had lowered to about 2,000 feet altitude.  Along the English Channel we encountered a high, solid cloud bank.  We had to fly under it on the deck as we could not fly over it.  As we circled about, waiting for the Navigator to give the Pilot a bearing for England, we started getting some flak. The hold-out pockets of Germans along the coast were shooting at us.  Lt. Aston gave Lt. Spagnola a heading and we lit out across the channel on the deck at 1,000 feet, flying under the cloud bank. We were sweating out fuel consumption and praying that the navigator knew his job.  After a seeming eternity watching the North Sea waves splashing just below us, North Foreland at Margate came into view right on course.  A heading now for Shipdham was a \"piece of cake\".  The crew was so happy to be back at the 44th, they hoisted the navigator up on their shoulders and cheered him.  Mission flight time was 9.0 hours.",

    "bioTripDetails": "Lt. McKenna's nephew, James P. McKenna, has submitted this information to be included in the database.\r\n\r\nThe mission on which Lt. McKenna was killed in actiion was to Hamburg, Germany on August 6, 1944.  Hamburg is a great port city but this day an oil refinery was the target.  Just after target this aircraft was hit by flak and went into a tight spin.  Two chutes were seen at first, then eight more.  Pilots were apparently able to pull it out of the spin once or twice, but then it would go back into a dive again.  It crashed in the target area with seven of the twelve men on baord surviving.  There was no accounting for the other three chutes observed.\r\n\r\n2nd Lt. Vincent W. WeRoux, navigator-radar on board this stricken aircraft, adds, \"The mission was routine until we hit Germany - all equipment was working beautifully.  We came in ovcer the North Sea and flew south in Germany.  It was a thousand-plane raid and shortly after entering Germany, we split into two groups.  500 planes went on to Berlin and our 500 hit Hamburg.\r\n\r\nWe had extensive flak all the way in but received no damage.  Shortly after bombs away, I heard someone yell, \"Look Out\" and we dropped about 1500 feet out of formation.  We had sustained a hit in the nose knocking out the intercom.  Later, I was told the #3 plane (in our element) came up and over us, then dropped down on us, forcing us out of formation to avoid a collision.\r\n\r\nBoth of the men in the nose section watched helplessly while they observed one German Battery begin tracking the plane.  With the intercom out, they couldn't warn Lt. McKenna.  Just as we were about to rejoin our formation, they hit us with all four guns.  We were hit in the nose, the waist and the #3 engine.  This engine exploded and two cylinder heads from it came through the side of our ship and landed in my lap.  I lost six to eight layers of skin from my palm when I tried to dislodge those burning hot objects.\r\n\r\nImmediately, the bomb bay floor ignited, with flames two to three feet high.  Lt. Goo Seemed to have been it by the flak, as he kept staggering around holding his stomach.  I pushed him back into his seat several times, but he wouldn't or couldn't stay there.  The fire extinguisher was behind Lt. Greno, Co-Pilot, I tried to reach it.  However, Captain Byrne was frozen to the bulkhead and I couldn't get past him.  I tried to pry his hands loose but was unable to do so.  Finally, I gave up and turned to see the flames were licking at Sgt. Sheldon's and he wa still in the top turret operating his guns.\r\n\r\nEscape from the flight deck through the bomb bay was impossible by now, and my hand was so badly burned I doubted if I could pull myself up and out ot the top hatch.  Finally, I saw the hole the cylinder heads made in the side of the plane and decided it was my way out.  I was fortunate that day to have picked up my new back pack chute and worn an asbestos lined suit for the first time.  If I had had my old chest pack, I would have been unable to exit through the hole in the side of the ship.  I threw myself out head first, but caught my feet in my chair or something.  I kept swinging back and forth in the slipstream until I finally tore loose.\r\n\r\nShortly after I ripped free, the plane went into a dive that turned into a spin.  I was captured shortly after landing.\r\n\r\nDouglas Hobbs, right waist gunner, sent additional information.  The ship was a \"mickey ship\" radar equipped for bombing through cloud cover.  But with clear weather over the tartget this equipment was not necessary and not utilized.  His account of the incident is very similar to that already recorded.\r\n\r\nThe capatured officers went to Barth, Germnay to Stalag Luft #1 and the enlisted men to the new Stalag Luft #6 and #4.  We were liberated by the English in early May, 1945.\r\n\r\nLt. Emmett Tucker said, \"I was flying a make-up mission to catch up with my regular crew (Lt. Peterson) and was in the nose turret.  When the sent into that right spin, I was unable to move for quite awhile.  When the plane came out of spin, I bailed out.  The bombardier, Forseth, went out first, then the navigator and then me.  I think the pilot and co-pilot wer killed by the flak hits, because when I went out of the bomb bay, I could see no movement in the upper part of the plane.  However, smoke was very bad.",

    "bioTripDetails": "Arriving in Shipdham late at night in a torential rain.  Being conned by my crew into believing beer and cider since I came from a non-alcholic consumption family.\r\n\r\nMy crew used my meddle name \"Reef\" to come up with the name \"Reffer and his 9 Weeds\".\r\n\r\nNearly losing my Radio Operator when the Radio compartment was blown out while he was holding the bomb bay doors actuating handle in the open position.\r\n\r\nA heated suit that let my feet freeze and my torso/chest sweat.  A stove in our hut that was cherry red and wouldn't throw heat 3 feet and always being cold in the England dampness making the wearing of flight gear a must. \r\n\r\nLanding at Bluie-I Greenland with a maingear flat tire and being the first bomber to land at ATC Base Mingan, Quebec throughout the entire war, (May 1945). \r\n\r\n                                    55 YEARS and the \"ADVENTURE CONTINUES\" \r\n\r\nIn 1944 we came together as a heavy bomber, B-24 Liberator crew. Clayton R. Roberts (Pilot), William A. Lundquist (CO-Pilot), Art Aronoff (Navigator), Joe Stewart (Bombardier), Kenneth Amick (Flight Engineer/Gunner), John Boileau (Radio Operator), Robert Dunlap (Gunner), Bill Cross (Gunner), Edgar Flowers (Gunner) and John \"Junior\" Roberts (Gunner). \r\n\r\nOur first crew picture was taken in 1944 at the Desoto Hotel in Savannah, Georgia on the eve of our departure for the United Kingdom. We delivered a B-24J from Mitchell Field, NY via Bangor, Maine and Goose Bay. Labrador to Valley, Wales. We were asigned to the 68th Bomb Squadron, 44th Bomb Group and flew bombing sorties over Europe. We suffered no casualties, but would have lost our radio operator when the \r\nradio compartment was blown out by flack had he not been following procedure--holding the bomb bay ]ever in the open position from the IP (initial Point) to bombs away. \r\n\r\nOur last flight as a crew was in May 1945 when we departed for Bradley Field, CT via Bluie West One, Greenland. After flying up a fiord with wing tips brushing rock walls we landed with a flat main gear. Fuel shortage necessitated an instrument landing, 100 foot ceiling and I mile visibility at the ATC field in Mingan, Quebec. We were the first heavy bomber to land there throughout the war and station personnel, who treated us like royalty, couldn't belive that we were so young and that a 22 year old was the Pilot. \r\n\r\nWe were broken up as a crew at Sioux Falls, SD in 1945 and went in ten different directions. Efforts by some of us to make contact over the years failed. In 1990 1 managed to locate Joe Stewart in Providence, RI. However, he passed away before we could get together. In April 2000 photograph #2 appeared in the Second Air Division Journal asking the identity of some members, which I recognized as my crew. This photo was submitted by Bob Dunlap and triggered a series of events that resulted in the five surviving members making contact, which culminated in the five of us -- Bill Lundquist, Art Aronoff, Bob Dunlap, \"Junior\" Roberts and myself--meeting for the first time in 55 years at the 44th Bomb Group Association annual reunion in San Diego, CA on 31 August 2000. \r\n\r\nThis reuniting and meeting after over half a century surpassed all our expectations. The feelings of comradeship, the rush of emotions and bonding have been intense. We are in daily to monthly contact and are committed to not losing contact again. We are scattered across the country. Bill Lundquist lives in Spokand, WA; Art Aronoff live in Stockbridge, MA; I live in Norwich, CT; Bob Dunlap lives in Austin, TX and \"Junior Roberts lives in Lake Charles, LA. It almost seems that we were destined to reuinte in the year 2000 because for the past 12 years, since 1988, 1 have passed within five miles of Stockbridge, MA and Art Aronoff as I traveled the Massachusetts Turnpike at least twice monthly. \r\n\r\nWe are the newest members of the Association and understand that we may be the crew with the most surviving members. Our coming together this late in life has brought new meaning into all our lives at a time when we thought meaninful experiences were behind us. Our reuniting in San Diego was the \"Mother of Experiences\" and the feeling was unanimous that we \"wouldn't have missed it for the world\". What we felt and experienced is beyond description and regrettably cannot be shared with others--",

After arriving in England we had to wait until November for our planes to arrive.  When the 506th Squadron arrived in May 1943.  I later transferred to the 506th as they were short of Crew Chiefs.\r\n\r\nThe first plane I had with the 506th had only a few missions and that plane went down in combat.  I don't remember much about this plane, it wasn't named.  A few weeks later, I received my second plane which was \"My Everlovin Gal.\"  It had completed 24 missions.  If I remember correctly she was on her 25th mission when shot down over Magdeburg, Germany, June 29th, 1944.\r\n\r\nMy next plane was \"My Gal Sal,\" it was one of the first B-24H and that plane had 14 missions completed when on August 30, 1944 it crashed on takeoff.  While waiting for another plane I went to work with another Crew Chief as he was short of help, worked for him until they gave me another plane.\r\n\r\nI was very saddened when we lost \"My Everlovin Gal,\" prayed every time our plane took off on a mission that everything would go well, and everyone would return safely.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime in January of 1945, I met my future wife in London at Covent Gardens.  She worked for the BBC, her name was Joan Clarke.  She lived in the suburb of Finchley.  We were maried on May 24, 1945.\r\n\r\nMy three years in the British Isles were memorable ones.  It was an education which I will never forget.\r\n\r\nIn June the 44th Bomb Group left for home.  I was discharged in September 1945.  My wife didn't arrive until March 1946.",

    "bioTripDetails": "S/Sgt Wilson's biography and experiences are summarized quite nicely in this speech he was asked to make by the Unitarian-Universalists concerning his spiritual journey through life.  \r\n\r\nI talked about eighty years of wandering about this Good Earth, possibly aimlessly, who knows?  All because I was spared an airman's death in 1944.\r\n\r\nNothing characterizes my life more than change in geogrpahy, being moved from place to place.  I wonder why I can't relax and accept retirement.  The word \"satisfaction\" is not in my vocabulary.\r\n\r\nIf you remember the movie story of Forest Gump, who was inquisitive, running and landing in the midst of things.  It rather explains my journey.\r\n\r\nPresident Cooledge held me in his arms as an infant at a whistle stop at my native Bethel, Vermont.  Later during the depression, in Daytona Beach, I ran after John D Rockefellow's open Lincoln picking up the dimes he threw out.  In 1936 FDR, a cripple, stopped at our dairy farm to talk with my dad.  Dad, bound by a wheelchair, was a cripple like Roosevelt.\r\nA Kennedy and Vanderbilt were college classmates and five years ago I sat on a platform with a Vice President of the United States both of us celebrating our College Reunion, he his 25th and I, my 50th.\r\n\r\nI was born in Vermont, than attended grade school in many places, Massachusetts, DC, South Carolina and Florida.  High School in New Hampshire.  Most of you have traveled to some extent, but I doubt if any of you were more constantly on the move than I was.\r\n\r\nMy dad was a casualty to trench warfare.  In September 1918 he sustained a knee injury which subsequently developed into a totally ankylosing rheumatoid arthritis.  Treatment for this disease and many others in the 1920's and 30's was to seek the right climate.  So around and around the eastern part of the United States we went.  Mother and me in coach travel, father up front on a crank bed in the baggage car.  \r\n\r\nSometimes we went by coastal transport to Savanna and Miami, on packet steamer.  I got to love trains and boats and being taken places.\r\n\r\nFor my military experience I completed Power Turret Maintenance training at Lowry Field, I left Denver in a Pullman sleeper as a highly skilled air craft armorer.  I awoke, freezing cold two days later, the only occupant of the car shunted to a siding at Warner Robbins Field, Macon, Ga.\r\n\r\nIn a few days someone learned I was a Harvard Man, thought I should be an officer.  I was asked in front of several Second Looies to bark out some marching orders (close order drill).  I failed miserably.  Next day, after sassing a mess Sargent and landing in the brig for 48 hours, I found myself being shipped out to Camp Kilmer and then to board the Queen Mary, where my pod was on top deck near the stern.  We ate K rations and responded with Air Raid warning exercise ( to go below) by moving but a rew feet.  The next order came for submarine attack (go to the rail) and I moved two feet back to my original position.  Ten thousand of us were on that liner.  Five and one-half days later we were in the Firth of Forth, Scotland and two weeks later at my destination Shpdham.\r\n\r\nThe 44th Bomb Groups was having some difficulty putting 36 aircraft up for every mission over Europe (missions came about two a week). The problem was sickness or injury in the air crews.  Small mishaps would take a man or two from the 11 man compliment and everyone would be idle.  Flyers were needed to fill the mising slots.  About 18 of the 506th Squadron's armorers volunteered to do so.  Without all the training state side, I found myself priviledged to fly in most any position (except engineer or pilot).  So it was for 31 missions.\r\n\r\nMy most hairy flying experience even worse than the flack and Messerschmidts occurred on my 15th or 16th mission. We were briefed to go to Osnabruck with a load of incendaries, magnesium sticks tied up in large bundles.  On that mission, I was riding in the Ball Turret.  We were making the run on the target loaded with fire bombs to drop as a follow- up on the 500 pounders that had come from the lead groups ahead of us.  As we swung onto the bomb run, I informed by intercom that our bomb bay doors had not opened.  This is not unusual, however.  Often the hydraulic mechanism would become frozen.  The orders were to aim and drop our cargo as usual, as the doors would break open from the weight and not being yet armed there would be o detonation.\r\n\r\nIt happens, that fire bombs are much lighter than the usual loads carried.  The sliding doors did not give way.  So there were all these sticks, hundreds of them, stacked up in the bomb bay, each with a wind driven arming devise whirling away.\r\n\r\nThe Waist Gunner cranked up my ball turret and I buckled on my parachute.  The two of us  were suddenly of one mind.  Why not jump on the trapped bomb load.  With the added weight the doors might break through.  That is what we did, hanging onto the wires and tubes on the ceiling of the fuselage.  What a relief to see all those hexagonal sticks fall into the sky below and finally to watch them as they reached the ground--red specks of fire in the Black Forest.\r\n\r\nOnly two times have I superstitiously kissed the ground on the return landing.  This time and once again landing at Windsor Locks, Conn. when my tour in the ETO was over and I was back on good old American soil to wait for Pacific duty which never came.\r\n\r\nWhen missions were completed stayed in Shipdham teaching use of Norden Bomb sight until the war ended.\r\n\r\nI met my wife to be at the Red Cross Club.  She was a WAAF from nearby Burleigh Hall.  The entire WAAF base was brought to Shipdham in a GI Truck.",

I know he flew on raids with the RAF, I believe in Lancaster Bombers.  Unfortunately, I have no records showing his service with the RAF.\r\n\r\nHe flew on the August 1, 1943 Ploesti raid as navigator for the Edward Mitchell crew along with Donald Decker, (co-pilot} Julio Castellotti ( w. gunner), Henry Flister (tail gunner), James Kipple (bombardier), David Collie (w. gunner), and Robert McAdams (flight engineer and top turret gunner).  John and all the crew were interned in Turkey.\r\n\r\nIn England he was stationed at Shipdham.  Unforgettable was sharing a barracks' room with Lts. Earl J. Guy, Morton R. Raylor and Richard S. Pick.  They \r\nheld round table discussions on philosophy and political science.  ( John (sad Sal Saladiak) forced his buddies to listen to Beethoven, Brahms, and Bach.\r\n\r\nJohn was married to Dorothy Nelson in East Dereham Parish Church on November 25, 1944.  The reception was held at the King's Arms Hotel, Dereham, Norfolk.\r\n\r\nWar injuries which plagued him for many years eventually led to the amputation of his right leg.\r\n\r\nHe enjoyed travelling in Eastern and Western Europe, spent much of his time reading and listening to classical music.  He and Dorothy were planning the celebration of their fifieth wedding anniversay when he died on September 15, 1994.",

    "bioTripDetails": "Some of my more memorable experiences were as Crew Chief of the Bar W.  One night we had a snow storm at Shipdham Air Base.  The next afternoon two officers came out and waited to fly Bar W.  When they came in they reported #3 engine was not running up, we pulled some cowling to check cylinders and found one cold, we changed the spark plug.  I got in the co-pilot's seat to check #3 out and had to lean over to read RPM's when I heard a loud clatter and looked out and had chopped the work stand which had been pulled out as was normal.  When reving #3 engine the plane swung around.  The snow had melted under the chocks to become ice.  Had to call Tony Yates, the prop man.  He brought out a new prop and installed it, everything checked out and the plane flew a mission the next day.\r\n\r\nAfter the war was over in Europe, the Bar W was fitted in the bomb bay to carry luggage for moving barracks bags of persons from Belgium to a base in England.  One afternoon two officers ask if we wanted to go along as engineer and assistant to Belgium fighter base to move men and luggage.  Tony Cirami and I readily agreed.\r\n\r\nThe base was close to Mons, Belgium.  After landing I noticed a tire was half flat, the pilot asked if I thought we could get back that way and I answered \"no\". They called Shipdham and another tire and wheel was to be sent over in the morning.  When we first arrived in Belgium and parked the plane, 2 fighter planes buzzed us.  The tower came over speakers and told them to stop and land.  Soon after that a red roadster with top down went by being driven by a fighter pilot of maybe 18.  I thought it something he had a car and a fighter plane.\r\n\r\nTony and I went to town for a short time.  We only had work clothes so had to borrow uniforms.  On returning from the town a crew had come that evening and changed the wheel to our surprise.  \r\n\r\nThe next afternoon a different pilot came, loaded the plane but could not get nose down, so he had me get all persons we could in cat walk in bomb bay and up front.  I was kneeling between pilots and calling air speed when the pilot reached over and pushed throttles to the max.  I looked up and saw that the pilot thought the runway ended being a fighter base, but they just went up hill and down.  After that scare we got of OK.  Arriving in England, pilot could not find the air field.  As I remember, they called Shipdham and got directions.  They had done a good job with camouflage but it was plain as day when we got over the field.\r\n\r\nNot many planes got 100 missions, we had 106 on Bar W.  Didn't have a regular crew, it was a lead plane and went on a mission every other day.  The other lead plane was from the 93rd group and sometimes both went on the same mission.\r\n\r\nIn 1944 4 Staff Sergeants of the 503rd Squadron became crew chiefs of B-24's,  John Omens, James Boyers, and one I cannot remember along with myself.  Our names were sent in to Wing for Master Sergeants, but the war was over before it was signed.",

That same year he married Janice Marion Green, whom he had met at Michigan.  After law school, Grover and Janice moved to Salem, Oregon where he worked for Governor Mark Hatfield revising the Oregon State Code and Constitution.  Subsequently, he practiced Wills and Estates in a Portland, Oregon,  While working in Oregon, they had their first child, Betsy.\r\n\r\nIn 1954, Grover took the Foreign Service entrance examination and in 1955, having received German language training, he was posted to the United Sttes Embassy in Bonn, Germany.  In 1956 , He was promoted to Legal Advisor to the US Mission in Berlin.  A son, Ward, was born in Berling and a daughter, Martha, was born in Bonn.  In 1959, Grover and family returned to the States where he was assigned to the State Department's Berlin Desk.\r\n\r\nIn 1965, after a year of Serbo-Croatian language training, Grover was assigned to the Political Diivsion of the US Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia  A fourth child, Anne, was born in Munich, Germany during the posting.  After the usual stint back in the United States, Grover went to Belfast, Northern Ireland as the US Consul General.  During that period, the political situation in Northern Ireland was very unstable and bomb blasts in and around the city of Belfast were commonplace.\r\n\r\nGrover and family moved from Northern Ireland to Monrovia, Liberia. In Liberia, Grover developed heart problems and was subsequently posted to Curacao in the Netherlalnds Antilles where there was a good Dutch hospital.

He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.\r\n\r\nA few things stand out about Grover.  He was devoted to his family.  He loved his wife and his children.  He always thought he had the best brothers.  He was a patriot who was proud to serve his country.  The flag flew outside the family home on every important holiday.  He enjoyed American History and made a point of visiting the great battlefield of the Revolutionary and Civil Wars as well as the homes of the US Presidents.  Grover had a sharp mind and thoroughly enjoyed a good intellectual debate.  He also had a strong sense of right and wrong. He felt that the most important thing he did was to march in the 1963 Civil Rights March.  He had a good sense of humor, enjoyed playing golf with sand greens and snakes that could kill you.  Although he endured serious health problems for a good part of his life, Grover did not let them dampen his enthusiasm for life.",

    "bioTripDetails": "I was a member of the Frank Sobotka Crew.  We flew eleven missions, had some flak damage, made two emergency landings at various fields, suffered some damage from enemy aircraft, but lucked out and came home safely each time except for our last mission, the twelfth.\r\n\r\nWe were scheduled to fly a \"Milk Runn\" just over the Channel to bomb the so called \"ski sites\".  This was ground equipment used to launch the buzz bombs toward England.  They were so named because the resembled ski jumps.\r\n\r\nWe drew  Tail End Charlie and because this was supposed to be a milk run at a comparatively low altitude (about 12,000 feet).  I didn't bother to dress with any heavy clothes just my light leather jacket and regular shoes. No boots.\r\n\r\nWe did not have any problems with our take-off and got into position and headed for the coast.  We arrived over our intended area but couldn't find the target.  Not an enemy plane in the sky and the flak was light.  We had great support from our P-47's.  We circled the fields looking for out target. I don't recall how long we looked before we finally saw them (they were well camouflaged).  By this time our air cover had returned to England to refuel.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediatley the sky was filled with enemy aircraft.  Of course, they started at Tail End Charlie.  The tail gun was knocked out first.  They circled and came at us from eleven o'clock high, knocking out the top turret and spraying the instrument panel with lead.  The control cables were severed, and the two engines on the left were on fire.  The plane started to roll to the left, went completely over and ended up in flat spin.  The bail out alarm had been sounded and looking out the window,.  I could make out three chutes, not knowing whether they were ours.  I knew we didn't have much time to bail out due to our low altitude, but the flat spin gave us a few more minutes.  I quickly put my chute on, grabbed my pilot's chute and put it in his lap has he continued to fight the controls while yelling at me to get going.\r\n\r\nAs I went toward the bomb bay to bail out, I glalnced up at the top turret and all I saw was a hole where it had been.  The radio operator was putting his chute on and signaled me to go ahead, he was following. I learned later that he didn't make it.  Neither did the pilot.  I was the last to jump.\r\n\r\nThose that didn't make it were Frank Sobotka, the pilot, Claire Shaeffer, the crew chief (top turret gunner), Tommy Capizzi, the radio operator and Clarence Reeves, the tail gunner.\r\n\r\nI later learned that the rest of my crew were all captured except for Abe Teitel, the bombardier and myself.  We ended up in the Underground.  Abe and I were in different parts so I never did get to see him, although I learned later that he got back okay.\r\n\r\nWhen I jumped and pulled the rip cord, the chute opened and I was so low that it only swung once before I hit the ground.  Luckily I landed in a clearing that was in a forested area.  I immediately gathered my chute, ran for the woods and hid out under the low lying brances of a pine tree.  I buried my chute and after thinking about it also hid my 45 pistol.  After all, who was I going to shoot?\r\n\r\nThings had happened so fast, and I was so hyper, I decided to stay there calm down and decide what my next move would be.  I rested for about a half hour before I crawled out and looked for a way out of the woods.  I thought I would head for Paris feeling that in a big city, it would be easier to get lost and possibly find a way to get into the Underground.  The only problem was my uniform.  How could I walk around with an American uniform on?  As luck would have it, as I came out of woods and started walking down a dirt road a woman came around a bend walking toward me.  She seemed startled at first then seeing my uniform and realizing I was an American, started chattering in rapid French.  I couldn't understand a word, but I finally figured out that she had seen the dog fight and the chutes of the men that had bailed out and realized that was where I had come from.\r\n\r\nShe was very excited and grabbed my hand, practically ran with me to her house which was close by.  I found out by sign language and using a few French words, that her husband had been taken by the Germans to a labor camp and she was working the farm by herself.  I stayed there that night, but couldn't stay longer because the Germans came by often.  Before I left she gave me some of her husband's clothes. I felt a little better about walking int he open, now that my uniform was hidden.\r\n\r\nThat day I walked until I was exhausted, thinking that I would hide in a barn for the night; but every time I approached a barn, a dog would start barking. I ended up going into a field and finding a haystack that I could burrow into and get a little sleep.  This happened for two more days,  I hadn't seen a German soldier in all this time.\r\n\r\nI had had nothing to eat or drink and was getting a little light headed and decided to knock on the next door I came to. Toward evening of my third day, I came across a small house and knocked on the door.  A man opened the door and we just stood there looking at each other.  I opened my shirt and showed him my uniform with the US pin on it.  He quickly pulled me in and closed and locked the door.  He spoke no English and I spoke no French, but we made ourselves understood.  He realized I was hungry and tired, so he fed me and took me into a back room where there was a mattress that I fell on and promptly fell asleep.  When I awoke he called a school teacher who spoke fair English.  I told him I was trying to get to the Underground.  He said he could help.  He left and when he came back, he had two bicycles with him.  He told me to follow him, and he led me to a house that looked deserted.  When I entered, I saw three men standing in the middle of the room.  They immediately surrounded me and started asking me questions.  What plane did I fly, where did I take my training, where did I live in the states, what school did I go to.  When they were satisfied that I was an American they shook my hand, patted me on the back and told me that I was not in the Underground.  I found out later, if they had any suspicion that I wasn't who I said I was, they would have shot me at once.\r\n\r\nOne of the men drove me to a farm house where I stayed for about a week.  A man and his wife and their teen age daughter who was studying English lived there.  I helped with the chores around the house and on the farm and helped the young girl with her English, while she tried to each me French.  I grew to really like the family, but all too soon, I was moved to another location.  This time I was with  one of the heads of the underground.  He took me with him to help him interview new evadees.  He said that I could tell easier than he could if these new arrivals were either American, English, or Canadian and not German trying to infiltrate.  Another one of my jobs was to help write phoney identification cards.  We would have photos taken and attach them to the caards.  We also made up travel permits.  I still have the ones I made for myself.\r\n\r\nI stayed with these people for over a month.  One of the men owned a flour mill, and he would hold meetings there with Underground personnel every so often.  By this time, I understood enough French to know what was going on.  They knew an invasion was inevitable, and they were planning what action they would take.  They had guns and ammunition hidden in various parts of the city that could be obtained easily and quickly.\r\n\r\nOne day word had filtered through that the Germans were suspicious of one of the men and were looking to question him.  The man whose house I was living in at that time said that he would probably have to get to England.  He was afraid the Germans were getting too close.  I told him that I would go with him and we started to plan our route.  We could either go through Switzerlland or across the Pyranees to Spain.  We decided on Spain.  It was easier to get to England from there.  Before we got started word came back that I was to be evacuated from a beach in Brittany by and English Corvette.  I was to be driven to the railroad station in Paris with my ID and travel permit.\r\n\r\nWhen the day came that I was to leave, I was driven to the depot and told to wait with one other evacuee at a certain place in the station.  We were to keep our eyes on three men that were standing under a clock on the far side of the station, and when they started to walk toward the ticket taker we should calmly follow them.  Not too closely.  I wondered how we would get through, we had no tickets.  While we were looking into a store window and smoking a cigarette, a German officer approached us.  We were given orders not to say one word to anyone, not even oui (yes) as our accent could be detected.  The officer approached and asked me, in French, if I would give him a light from my cigarette.  He thanked me and left.  No sooner was he out of sight than one of the men under the clock rushed over and asked what had taken place.  I told him and assured him that I had not spoken one word.\r\n\r\nPeople were starting to go toward the ticket taker's gate and it was time for us to go also.  We followed the men under the clock and when they got to the gate they nodded to the ticket agent and gave him their ticket.  They got back a stub and continued on to the train.  I got to the gate and held my breath as I started throught.  Without hesitation the gate man nodded at me and gave me a ticket stub which I have to this day.  Obviously he was part of the Underground.  I got on the train, and as it started, I noticed two German soldiers checking the passengers ticket stubs and ID's.  This made me a little nervous because I saw them asking some of the speople something. When they came to me I had my ticket stub and ID in my hand ready for them.  They asked me for my travel permit and I breathed a sigh of relief.  I didn't have to talk to them I just reached into my pocket and showed it to them.  They looked it over, seemed satisfied and moved on.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at our destination which was a small town on the coast of Brittany, we were met by a truck (there were about eight of us on the train) that took us to a farmhouse about a mile inland.  We went into a large barn next to the house.  Straw on the floor was pushed aside to uncover a trap door built into the floor.  We were led down a ladder into a large room in which there were about thirty escapees.  We were all happy to see each other and shook hands all around, gave our names and told our stories.  We were told that an English Corvette would come to take us across the Channel as soon as there was a new moon which would occur in two days.  In the meantime we were given food and wine.  In the evening we were given blankets and pads on which we slept.\r\n\r\nThe night we were to leave finally arived.  We were given strict instructions on how we were to proceed to the coast.  We were warned that the coast was heavily guarded and we should be perfectly quiet while we walked in single file toward the beach.  It was dark as pitch when we started.  Not a light was seen.  We headed toward the coast single file as instructed.  We went down a dirt path bordered by four foot hedgerow and each side.  We had gone no further than fifty yeards when one of our guides came running back whispering to us to jump over the hedgerow and hide quietly behind it.  It seemed to me that we made one hell of a commotion jumping over the bushes and landing on one another before we settled down, but a few minutes later two men came strolling by chatting to each other and not even realizing that just a few feet from them about forty men wee waiting for them to pass. \r\n\r\nWe continued down the path until we were stopped near the beach.  Two German soldiers were on sentry duty walking back and forth.  The walked toward each other and when they met would exchange a few words, turn around and walk back.  When they were far enough away, the guide in front of our column would tap three or four of us to sneak by and slide down the cliff to the beach before the sentries turned around to come back.  When we were all down, we waited for the Corvette to come in and pick us up. (Twenty years later, my wife and I had a chance to go back there, and all I can say is that I was glad it was a dark night, because I don't see how we all made it down without casualties. I would never have tried it in the day light>)  We were told to take off our shoes and put our socks in them, tie the laces together and put them around our neck and roll our pants up over our knees.  The Corvette launched three row boats toward the beach and we walked out to meet them.  Little did it help to roll our pants up.  We were up to our waist before we knew it.\r\n\r\nWe boarded the \"Corvette\" and were treated royally by the crew and cruised to England, interrogated thoroughly and eventually returned to our group.\r\n\r\nMy wife and I did go back, and I followed the same route I had taken twenty years erlier.  Every one I met remembered me; and at every place I stopped, friends and neighbors were invited in, and we had party after party.  I still have many friends in France that I correspond with to this day and we go back to see them quite often.",

I was a Radar Operator on B-24 Flying Patrol.\r\n\r\nOn August 21, 1943, the 6th Anti Submarine Squadron combat crews and ground chiefs only moved to Dunkeswell, England.  We were assigned to the 479th Anti Submarine Group.\r\n\r\nOn Sept. 21, 1943, the B-24's and personnel of the 6th Anti Submarine Squadron based at Dunkeswell, England were transferred to various bomb groups of the Second Air Division.   I was transferred to the 67th Squadron of the 44th Bomb Group.\r\n\r\nIn the transfer, flying personnel were given credit for bombing missions according to the number of hours each had in Anti Submarine flying time.  I was given credit for 20 missions.  At that time 25 missions were required.  However, Radar Operators were not permitted to fly over enemy held areas.  So I was not able to complete my tour at that time.\r\n\r\nIt was in early 1944 that radar counter measures were being developed to \"jam\" enemy flak guns radar.  This is when idled radar operators were called.  On March 14, 1944, I was transferred to the 417th Signal Bn. AAF Sta. 101.  March 22nd I was sent on temporary duty (7 days) to American Brititsh Labs, 15 TRE Great Malvern, England to carry out verbal instruction of C.O.  Here electronic counter measure equipment was being developed and built.  After receiving training and instructions concerning this equipment, I returned to the 417th Bn.  On May 21, 1944, I was the Radar Operator on the first mission using the counter measure equipment designed and built at ABL.  Soon other aircraft were equipped with counter measure.\r\n\r\nMy last mission was June 20, 1944.  At that time 30 missions were required, so I flew 10 missions as Counter Measure Operator between May 21 and June 20.  I do not remember the names of pilots or crews who flew the B-24 with counter measure equipment.\r\n\r\nJuly 1, 1944 I was assigned to 803rd Bomb Squadron RAF Station, Oulton, England as a Radar Counter Measure Instructor in B-17 and B-24s.  On July 30, 1944 returned to 44th Bomb Group.",

It was decided the Queen should make a run for it because of her speed.  We were put on a zig-zag course - no stabalizers for sound control.  I think I was the only one on board not sick.\r\n\r\nI became a member of the Air Corps in a strange way.  I was due to get my Commission through Infantry ROTC  in May of 1942.  The reward for being top of the class was the ability to transfer in grade to Aira Corps or Marines.  I was a flying nut - already had my Private License through the  Civilian Flight Training Program run by the University.  I had it all set up to go directly to Flying School but received a change of orders enroute to report to the Commanding Officer, Barksdale Field, LA.  Reported in - explained my mission - was told firmly that it was easier to train a Pilot than an Administrator.  I was made the Adjutant of the 67th Bombardment Squadron and was in command of the ground eschelon and was taking them overseas.  \"Twenty-one years old,\" thank God for Captain Howard Moore, the Squadron CO and Sergeants Bob Ryand and Fitzgerald, namely First Sergeant and Sgt. Major.  With their help I grew up fast.  I made the rank of Captain of April 8, 1943.",

Jack B. Ketchum, had picked up an aircraft at Wharton, England, along with six other passengers.  On the 13th they were enroute to Iceland on their first leg of the return to US.  Not long into the flight, this plane was heard flying very low in the vicinity of Gairlock, western Scotland.  The supposition is that the crew was trying to get below the thick clouds in order to obtain a visual fix, apparently having difficulty with their navigation.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the cloud cover was down below the mountainour terrain and the aircraft first struck one of the high peaks, glanced off it and continued in flight but badly damaged, especially in the tail section and could have been on fire.  A short distance away, it could no longer remain airborne and crashed in the Fairey Lochs region, not far from the village of Gairlock, Soctland.\r\n\r\nFurther information on the mystery surrounding this sad flight can be obtained in a book written by Mark Vance of Charlotte, NC., a pilot for USAir and the nephew of one of the men aboard the ill-fated plane.  This book is entitled \"Flight of the Forgotten\".",
